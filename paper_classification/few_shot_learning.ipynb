second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full icu capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. the optimal scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly. we also provide optimal intervention measures with increasing icu capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious and immune individuals. whenever massive resources are introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals to be more moderate.', 'abstract:  us  state  alcohol  consumption  patterns  and  trends  are  examined  in  order  to  identify  groups  of  states  with  similar  drinking  habits  or  cultures.  rates  of  heavy  drinking  and  current  abstention  and  per  capita  apparent  consumption  levels  are  used  to  categorize  states. six state groupings were identified: north central and new england with the highest  consumption  and  heavy  drinking  levels;

26.4% identified methamphetamines as their primary substance of use. frequency  of use was identified as an effect modifier, therefore results were stratified by less than weekly  use and weekly or more use. methamphetamine use was significantly associated with leaving  treatment against professional advice regardless of usage level. however, the odds of leaving  treatment were greater among women using methamphetamine less than weekly. further inves- tigation into this association may be warranted due to the complications that may result from  methamphetamine use during pregnancy. keywords: pregnancy, methamphetamines, treatment, attrition', 'abstract introduction: the development of left ventricular remodelling after acute myocardial infarction is a predictor of heart  failure and mortality. the purpose of the present study was to assess whether the polymorphism of angiotensinogen  (agt) gene with threonine (t) instead of methionine (m) at amino acid 235 in exon 2 (m235t) had effects on cardiac  remodelling after acute myocardial infarction. methods: one hundred and forty-one patients (mean age 56.4±11.1 years) with a first acute myocardial infarction were  enrolled. within 24–72 hours of the onset of the symptoms and at a four month period two-dimensional echocardiog- raphy  was  performed.  remodelling  was  defined  as  a  20%  increase  from  the  baseline  in  left  ventricular  end-diastolic  volume. the genotypes of the study group were compared with the reference group (n=1010) genotypes. agt m235t  polymorphism was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: at follow-up, 49 patients (34.7%) were classified as having left ventricular remodelling. anterior localization of  the infarct (p=0.008), leucocyte count at admission (p=0.040), global left ventricular longitudinal strain (p=0.021) and mm  genotype of agt (p=0.024) were independent predictors of ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction. conclusions: anterior wall infarction, increased leucocyte count, decreased longitudinal strain of left ventricular and poly- morphism of agt m235t may predict remodelling after myocardial infarction.', 'abstract:  zahavi’s  handicap  principle  suggests  that  only  organisms  with  good  genetic  quality can afford to engage  in costly  behaviors.  recreational drug use can  be  harmful  to  one’s health and therefore might be viewed as a costly signal of one’s genetic quality. one  of  the  measurements  of  genetic  quality  is  bodily  symmetry  assessed  by  fluctuating  asymmetry. if unhealthy drug use is a behavioral example of zahavi’s handicap principle,  then  men  who  use  different  stimulants  or  recreational  drugs  should  be  more  symmetrical  than men who do not use them at all or use them only in low quantity. the aim of this study  was  to  examine  the  relationships  between  drug  use  and  fluctuating  asymmetry.  the  subjects  were  190  young  women  and  202  young  men.  six  bilaterally  symmetrical  traits  were  measured:  length  of  ii–v  digits,  wrist  breadth,  and  ear  height.  questionnaires  included questions about smoking, alcohol drinking, drug use, and designer drug use. there  was  no  relationship  between  bodily  symmetry  and  smoking  frequency,  alcohol  drinking  frequency,  drug  or  designer  drug  use,  total  substance  use,  age  of  smoking  initiation,  or  reason of this  initiation. the results  indicate that drug use does not reflect genetic quality  and does not necessarily relate to the handicap hypothesis. ', 'abstract objective: factors in the practice environment, such as health information technology (it) infrastructure, availability of other clinical resources, and financial incentives, may influence whether practices are able to successfully implement the patient- centered medical home (pcmh) model and realize its benefits. this study investigates the impacts of those pcmh-related elements on primary care physicians’ perception of quality of care. methods: a multiple logistic regression model was estimated using the 2004 to 2005 cts physician survey, a national sample of salaried primary care physicians (n ¼ 1733). results: the patient-centered practice environment and availability of clinical resources increased physicians’ perceived quality of care. although it use for clinical information access did enhance physicians’ ability to provide high quality of care, a similar positive impact of it use was not found for e-prescribing or the exchange of clinical patient information. lack of resources was negatively associated with physician perception of quality of care.', \"the risk of developing tuberculosis (tb) may be related to nutritional status. to determine the impact of nutritional status on tb incidence, the authors analyzed data from the first national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes i) epidemiologic follow-up study (nhefs). nhanes i collected information on a probability sample of the us population in 1971-1975. adults were followed up in 1982-1992. incident tb cases were ascertained through interviews, medical records, and death certificates. tb incidences were compared across different levels of nutritional status after controlling for potential confounding using proportional hazards regression appropriate to the complex sample design. tb incidence among adults with normal body mass index was 24.7 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval (ci): 13.0, 36.3). in contrast, among persons who were underweight, overweight, and obese, estimated tb incidence rates were 260.2 (95% ci: 98.6, 421.8), 8.9 (95% ci: 2.2, 15.6), and 5.1 (95% ci: 0.0, 10.5) per 100,000 person-years, respectively. adjusted hazard ratios were 12.43 (95% ci: 5.75, 26.95), 0.28 (95% ci: 0.13, 0.63), and 0.20 (95% ci: 0.07, 0.62), respectively, after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and medical characteristics. a low serum albumin level also increased the risk of tb, but low vitamin a, thiamine, riboflavin, and iron status did not. a population's nutritional profile is an important determinant of its tb incidence.\", 'abstract background: compared to patients with similar levels of hypertension, patients with primary aldosteronism have a  greater left ventricular hypertrophy (lvh). the presence of lvh should be detected as early as possible to prevent  cardiovascular complications associated with the condition. we evaluated comparative diagnostic value of electrocardio- graphic (ecg) indexes for lvh in patients with primary aldosteronism. methods: ecg and echocardiographic data were obtained in 88 patients with primary aldosteronism. we analyzed the  four most commonly used ecg indexes, including sokolow-lyon index, cornell voltage index, cornell product index,  and gubner index. results: echocardiographic lvh was found in 35 patients (40%). sensitivity ranged from 0% for gubner index to 49% for  cornell product index. specificity ranged from 81% for sokolow-lyon index to 100% for gubner index. sokolow-lyon index  (r=0.43, p<0.001), cornell voltage index (r=0.55, p<0.001) and cornell product index (r=0.52, p<0.001) correlated signifi- cantly with left ventricular mass (lvm) index. no significant correlation was found between gubner index and lvm index. conclusions: ecg indexes had a  reasonably  high  specificity, but a low sensitivity for lvh  in patients with primary  aldosteronism. cornell voltage index and cornell product index had a better diagnostic value of lvh, and had a better  correlation with lvm index in these patients.', 'abstract it is argued that to improve health, health systems are required to meet people’s needs and therefore health systems should  identify these needs and find a way to prioritize these. for those with chronic diseases, these needs are necessary to manage  their condition and go beyond purely the health system. a literature search found that studies published on identifying the  needs of people with chronic diseases fall into the following categories: standardized tools, comparison of needs between  individuals and health professionals, tools for evaluation, and description of needs. this review highlights the gap between  tools used to assess health care needs versus needs for health. it found that a considerable portion of articles focused solely  on health care needs. many tools focused specifically on psychological or psychosocial needs and only one tool identified  included a broad range of needs for health. the literature fails to address the wider needs of people with chronic conditions  and is still focused on medical interventions. given the disease burden and the impact of needs outside of the formal health  system, needs assessments should be able to capture the full range and scope of the needs of an individual.', 'abstract objectives: to assess clinical and laboratory parameters associated with metabolic syndrome in turkish patients with moderate or severe plaque-type psoriasis and nonpsoriatic controls. methods: patients with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis (patient group) or with nonpsoriatic dermatological disease (controls) were included. waist circumference, weight, height and arterial blood pressure were measured, together with fasting blood glucose, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein (hdl), fibrinogen, homocysteine and adiponectin levels. metabolic syndrome was diagnosed using national cholesterol education program–adult treatment panel iii criteria. results: out of 90 patients (50 with psoriasis; 40 controls), metabolic syndrome was more frequent in the patient group than in controls. in terms of metabolic syndrome parameters, only hypertension was more frequent in patients with psoriasis compared with controls. there was no statistically significant difference between the patient and control groups for obesity, hypertrigly- ceridaemia, hdl levels or hyperglycaemia. fibrinogen levels were increased and adiponectin levels were decreased in the psoriasis group. no between-group difference in homocysteine levels was found. conclusion: in this small study, metabolic syndrome was found to be more frequently identified in turkish patients with psoriasis than in controls; metabolic syndrome could lead to increased cardiovascular disease risk in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.', 'abstract: injuries and violence among young people have a substantial emotional, physical, and economic toll on society. understanding the epidemiology of this public health problem can guide prevention efforts, help identify and reduce risk factors, and promote protective factors. we examined fatal and nonfatal unintentional injuries, injuries intentionally inﬂicted by other (i.e., assaults and homicides) among children ages 0–19, and intentionally self-inﬂicted injuries (i.e., self-harm and suicides) among children ages 10–19. we accessed deaths (1999–2015) and visits to emergency departments (2001–2015) for these age groups through the centers for disease control and prevention’s (cdc) web-based injury statistics query and reporting system (wisqars), and examined trends and differences by age, sex, race/ethnicity, rural/urban status, and injury mechanism. almost 13,000 children and adolescents age 0–19 years died in 2015 from injury and violence compared to over 17,000 in 1999. while the overall number of deaths has decreased over time, there were increases in death rates among certain age groups for some categories of unintentional injury and for suicides. the leading causes of injury varied by age group. our results indicate that efforts to reduce injuries to children and adolescents should consider cause, intent, age, sex, race, and regional factors to assure that prevention resources are directed at those at greatest risk.', 'abstract nonprescription  drug  labels  are  relatively  ineffective  in  refuting  drug  misconceptions.  we  sought  to  improve  the  effectiveness of  an  aspirin  label  as  a refutation text  by manipulating selective  attention  and  label-processing  strategy.  after reading a facsimile label, those of 196 undergraduates who attempted to explain why shaded drug facts are “easily  confused”  recalled  more  refuting  drug  facts  than  participants  who  attempted  to  explain  why  those  facts  are  “easily  ignored.” however, “easily confused” processing did not change truth ratings of misconceptions associated with those  drug facts. we conclude that refuted misconceptions remain in memory but are inhibited by disconfirming drug facts.', 'abstract objective: to explore mean food group intakes associated with central obesity anthropometry among children and adolescents enrolled in the third national health and nutrition examination survey (nhanes iii). design: cross-sectional study. setting: representative sampling of the us population (1998–2002). subjects: subjects were 3761 children (5–11 years) and 1803 adolescents (12–16 years) with single 24 h dietary recalls and anthropometric measures of central body fat (waist circumference and sum of subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses). results: results were controlled for confounding by age, height, race/ethnicity, tanner stage, television viewing and parental education. in younger children, there was no relationship between central adiposity and mean intakes of dairy, fruit, vegetables or grains, while a positive association with meat intake was found among boys. in adolescent boys and girls, central body fat measures were inversely associated with mean dairy and grain intakes. adolescent boys in the highest quartile of central adiposity consumed less fruit and fewer vegetables; those in the lowest central adiposity quartile consumed less meat. finally, ado- lescents who met the criteria for central obesity (waist circumference $85th percentile for age and sex) reported consuming signiﬁcantly less total dairy (as well as milk and cheese separately), total grains (whole and reﬁned) and total fruit and vegetables. there was no association with meat consumption. to test the stability of these ﬁndings, the ﬁnal analysis was replicated in 2541 same-aged adolescents from nhanes 1999–2002; the results were very similar. conclusions: these cross-sectional analyses suggest that intakes of dairy, grains and total fruits and vegetables are inversely associated with central obesity among adolescents.', 'abstract growing evidence indicates that self-compassion is associated with better physical health, but the pathways that mediate  this  relationship  are  not  well  understood.  this  study  tested  a  serial  mediation  model  that  linked  self-compassion,  perceived stress, health behaviors, and a comprehensive index of physical health. a sample of 176 individuals completed  an online survey posted on amazon’s mechanical turk. self-compassion had an indirect effect on physical health via both  mediators and through the sequential pathway, suggesting that taking a kind, accepting and mindful stance toward one’s  flaws and failures may have benefits for reducing stress and promoting health behaviors.', 'abstract psychological well-being has been linked with better health, but mostly with cross-sectional evidence. using midus,  a national sample of us adults (n = 4963), longitudinal profiles of well-being were used to predict cross-time change  in self-reported health  over  9–10 years. well-being was  largely  stable,  although adults differed in whether they had  persistently high versus persistently low or moderate levels of well-being. after adjusting for sociodemographic factors,  those with persistently high well-being reported better health (subjective health, chronic conditions, symptoms, and  functional  impairment)  across  time  compared  to  those  with  persistently  low  well-being.  furthermore,  persistently  high  well-being  was  protective  of  improved  health  especially  among  the  educationally  disadvantaged.  the  findings

mortality is the result of recent down- turns in lung and bronchus cancer deaths, prostate cancer deaths, and colon and rec- tum cancer deaths. ', 'abstract this study aimed to investigate the different dimensions of well-being (namely, work engagement, job satisfaction, and  psychological stress) and possible predictors such as personality and perceived organizational support. a cross-sectional  survey design was used, with a sample of 490 ambulance personnel in the united kingdom. significant correlations were  found  between  the  dimensions  of  job  satisfaction,  engagement,  and  stress.  the  results  also  supported  a  hierarchical  model with job satisfaction, stress, and engagement loading onto one higher order factor of work well-being. emotional  stability and perceived organizational support were identified as significant predictors of well-being. the findings suggest  the  importance  of  measuring  the  work-related  well-being  of  ambulance  personnel  holistically  and  present  perceived  organizational support as a possible area for interventions to improve well-being.', 'abstract objective: ketamine-associated cystitis (kac) has been described in a few case reports, but its treatment in a relatively large number of patients has not been documented. this study aimed to describe our experience of treatment of 36 patients with kac. methods: thirty-six patients (30 males and 6 females, aged 19–38 years) with kac, who had previously taken a muscarinic receptor blocker and/or antibiotics, but without symptomatic relief, were treated with botulinum toxin a injection combined with bladder hydrodistention. urodynamic testing, and the o’leary–sant interstitial cystitis symptom index (icsi) and problem index (icpi) were used to evaluate baseline values and improvement before and after the treatment. results: one month post-treatment, all patients achieved marked relief of symptoms. the nocturia time was markedly reduced, while bladder capacity, the interval between micturition, the void volume, and the maximum flow rate were remarkably increased at 1 month. additionally, the icsi and icpi were significantly improved. conclusion: botulinum toxin a injection along with bladder hydrodistention is effective for managing kac.', 'abstract background.  interventions  are  needed  to  alleviate  memory  difficulty  in  cancer  survivors.  we  previously  showed  in  a  phase iii randomized clinical trial that yocas©® yoga—a program that consists of

covid-19 that started in mid-february 2021. the wave first arose in the state of maharashtra, and within it, mumbai was amongst the first cities to see the increase. was this wave caused by increased laxity in the population around december and january? or by the opening up of the economy and public transportation on february 1, particularly in mumbai? did variants of the sars-cov-2 virus that have emerged in maharashtra and other parts of india play a role in the sharpness with which the virus has spread? very likely all three played a role, and especially the variants. while the significance of the role of variants remains to be confirmed by researchers, it appears that the double mutant variant b.1.617 [1] may have played a key role in maharashtra. unfortunately, we currently lack the data to firmly establish infectiousness, prevalence and virulence of b.1.617, or that of other variants that may be active, compared to the strains that were prevalent in mumbai last year. fortunately, vaccinations have started in india since mid-january and are being administered with some urgency in mumbai since mid-march and are likely to reduce infections and fatalities in the coming months. in this report, we use and enhance the iisc-tifr city simulator [2] to computationally study the second wave in mumbai. we build upon our earlier analysis [3], where projections were made from november 2020 onwards. given the inherent uncertainty in the role of the variants, and other important infection spread determining factors, we use our simulator to conduct an extensive scenario analysis - we play out many plausible scenarios through varying economic activity, reinfection levels, population compliance, infectiveness, prevalence and lethality of the possible variant strains, and infection spread via local trains to arrive at those that may better explain the second wave fatality numbers.', 'abstract background: studies derived from continuous national surveys

increase over the past few decades. musculoskeletal  disorders related to work are a major cause of disability in working individuals. the objective of this study was to verify the  associations between weight status and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in different body regions among workers.  the sample comprised 203 factory workers. anthropometric measures were assessed with standardized protocols and body  mass index (bmi) was calculated. participants were classified as nonoverweight (bmi ≤ 24.9 kg/m2) or overweight/obese (bmi  ≥  25  kg/m2).  musculoskeletal  pain  and  related  symptoms  was  assessed  with  the  nordic  questionnaire  of  osteoarticular  symptoms. the association of bmi and musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms was analyzed with logistic regression.  overweight/obese participants were more likely to have musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms in the shoulders (odds  ratio [or] = 2.129, p = .023). our results emphasize the need of worksite interventions to promote healthy weight as a way  to prevent musculoskeletal pain and related symptoms.', 'abstract background—an increase in the preva- lence of obesity and asthma over recent decades has been reported in azuent societies. both overweight and obesity have been shown to be inversely related to having been breastfed, which is also a potential protective factor against child- hood atopic diseases. the aim of this analysis was to explore the relation of body mass index (bmi) to asthma and atopy in a large representative sample of the united states population. methods—children aged 4–17 years were included in the nhanes iii survey. preva- lences of atopic diseases and potential con- founding factors such as exposure to environmental birth tobacco weight, breast feeding, and household size were assessed using structured interviews with parents. height and weight were measured, and bmi was calculated as kg/m2 and transformed into z scores. chil- dren underwent skin prick tests for atopy to a battery of food and inhalant allergens. results—the prevalence of asthma (8.7% v 9.3% v 10.3% v 14.9%, p=0.0001) and atopy (48.6% v 50.5% v 53.0% v 53.2%, p=0.05) rose signiﬁcantly with increasing quartiles of bmi. after adjustment for confounders, a signiﬁcant positive associ- ation between bmi and asthma remained (adjusted or 1.77, 95% conﬁdence inter- val 1.44 to 2.19 between the highest and lowest quartiles of bmi), whereas no independent relation between bmi and atopy was evident. no evect modiﬁcation by sex or ethnic group was seen. conclusions—the evects of increased bmi on asthma may be mediated by mechanical properties of the respiratory system associated with obesity or by upregulation of inﬂammatory mecha- nisms rather than

mental ill health accounts for 13 per cent of total global disease burden with predictions that depression alone will be  the leading cause of disease burden globally by 2030. poor mental health is consistently associated with deprivation,  low  income,  unemployment,  poor  education,  poorer  physical  health  and  increased  health-risk  behaviour.  a  plethora  of  research  has  examined  the  relationship  between  physical  activity  and  mental  wellbeing;  however,  the  influence  of  community-wide gamification-based physical activity interventions on mental wellbeing, to the authors’ knowledge, is yet  to be explored. in view of this paucity of attention, the current study examined the relationship between physical activity  and mental wellbeing pre/post a community-wide,

 between increase in physical activity and increase in mental wellbeing was observed.', 'abstract background: the national institutes of health is one of the largest biomedical research agencies in the world. clinical trials are an important component of national institutes of health research efforts. given the recent updates in national institutes of health trial reporting requirements, more information regarding the current state of national institutes of health–funded clinical trials is warranted. the objective of this analysis was to describe characteristics and trends of clinical trials funded by the national institutes of health over time and by institutes and centers of the national institutes of health. methods: interventional studies funded by the national institutes of health and registered in clinicaltrials.gov between 2005 and 2015 were included in the analysis. trials were identified from the 27 march 2016 clinical trials transformation initiative aggregate analysis of clinicaltrials.gov database. a descriptive analysis of trials by year and national institutes of health institute/center was performed. results: there were 12,987 national institutes of health–funded clinical trials registered between 2005 and 2015. there were 1,580, 1,116, and 930 trials registered in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. the majority were early- development trials (phases 0, 1, or 2; 53%), randomized (61%), and single-center (63%). trial demographics have remained unchanged over time. median trial sample size was 64 (interquartile range 29–192) with 10% of trials enrolling (cid:2)500 participants. most trials were completed within 5 years of enrollment start (69%). trial characteristics varied con- siderably across national institutes of health institutes and centers. results were reported under the assumptions that most national institutes of health–funded trials are registered in clinicaltrials.gov and that trials are being registered completely and accurately. conclusion: in conclusion, there has been a decline in the number of trials being funded over time, explained in part by a relatively constant budget, increases in trial costs, or other factors that cannot be quantified. national institutes of health–funded trials are relatively small and tend to be single-centered. there are substantial differences in the number and types of trials done by institutes and centers within the national institutes of health.', 'abstract introduction: angiotensin i converting enzyme (ace) insertion and deletion (i/d) polymorphism has been implicated  in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (oa). in recent years, numerous genetic factors have been identified and implicated  in oa. in this asian indian population-based study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between ace (i28005d) gene  polymorphism and primary oa. we performed a case-control association study to identify and explore the correlation  between clinically, radiologically diagnosed individuals with primary knee oa and the ace i/d polymorphism. methods: genomic dna was isolated from 200 samples, including 100 oa cases and 100 healthy volunteers. dna was  amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using i and d allele-specific primers. pcr products were assessed via uv  visualization of products electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. results: the groups differed significantly in genotype distributions (p < 0.05). the primary knee oa group showed a  considerably higher incidence of the dd genotype and the d allele compared to the control group (or =

obesity-related health conditions are rising. while physicians understand the need to improve patient health by promoting a healthy lifestyle, the advancement of nutrition education in medical school and residency is not keeping pace. this is evident in the inadequate time dedicated to nutrition education by medical schools and in the dissatisfaction of medical students and residents with their medical nutrition training. the aim of the current study was to investigate how food, diet, nutrition, and obesity are represented in the u.s. medical school licensing examinations (usmle) as a potential incentive to better match medical nutrition curricula to the modern societal needs. we semi-quantitatively analyzed nutrition-related information of the usmle step 1, 2, and 3 content description documents and two test preparation books, using qrs nvivo 10. the software's coding comparison query was used as reliability statistics. we found an adequate amount of nutrition references. however, the content of the references was inadequate in that there was minimal information in regards to chronic diseases and no content related to disease prevention. moreover, there was a lack of specifics in regards to food and nutritional science. we propose a content adjustment to the medical licensing exams to ensure that future physicians are more skilled and comfortable in

(ec95). methods: patients with an american society of anesthesiologists physical status i and ii, aged 19– 60 years undergoing elective surgery were enrolled in this study. when target ce of remifentanil was reached, desflurane was inhaled at 4 vol% initially and then it was increased to 8 and 12 vol% at intervals of 30 s. smooth induction was regarded as an absence of airway irritation

between range in blood pressure and first care-needs certification in the long-term care insurance (ltci) system or death in community-dwelling older subjects with or without ckd. methods: ckd was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or dipstick proteinuria of þ or greater. our study was conducted in 1078 older subjects aged 65–94 years. associations were estimated using the cox proportional hazards model. results: during 5 years of follow-up, 135 first certifications and 53 deaths occurred. among patients with ckd, moderate sbp (130–159 mmhg) was associated with a significantly lower adjusted risk of subsequent total certification (hazard ratio [hr] ¼ 0.44) and subsequent certi- fication owing to dementia (hr ¼ 0.17) compared with sbp < 130 mmhg. these relationships were not observed in non-ckd subjects. conclusion: lower sbp of <130 mmhg may predict a higher risk for subsequent first care- needs certification in ltci, especially for dementia, in community-dwelling patients with ckd.', 'covid-19 has caused hundred of thousands of deaths and an economic damage amounting to trillions of dollars, creating a desire for the rapid development of vaccine. once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. while o cial vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided rst (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. to demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for infectious diseases like covid-19. for inhomogeneous infection patterns, locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers r0 1:5 4 the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. for r0 1 we still nd a signi cant increase of the survival rate. the proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for o cial guidelines.', 'abstract: although  the

significant decline in access to nursing home care services for individuals  living in states in which courts consistently ruled that medicaid reimbursements did not meet the minimum standard implied  by federal law. the findings suggest that nursing home care services were made more accessible through a combination of  legislative and judicial oversight of medicaid payment policies.', 'abstract aim: we investigated whether aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor, provided protection in a model of diabetic nephropathy  in mice and compared its protective effects to valsartan, an angiotensin ii

or programs that increase behavioral skills or motivation coupled with skills building. although  some hiv/std prevention interventions, such as motivational interviews do attempt to capitalize on this relationship, more  efforts should be made to incorporate this important link into high impact prevention programs.', 'abstract objective: to identify the unique clinical features and biological markers of lung cancer-associated stroke. methods: we recruited 102 patients with lung cancer plus stroke, 102 with lung cancer, and 102 with stroke. detailed information was analysed and compared among groups. results: the groups were age-matched. patients with lung cancer plus stroke showed multiple lesions involving multiple cerebral artery territories on magnetic resonance imaging, compared with stroke-alone patients. these patients also had a poorer modified rankin scale score at 30 days, and high mortality (18.6%). patients with lung cancer plus stroke had a higher incidence of metastasis, and higher blood levels of d-dimer, ca125 and ca199 compared with patients with lung cancer alone. multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that levels of d-dimer, ca125 and ca199 were independently related to lung cancer-associated stroke. conclusion: elevated plasma d-dimer, ca125 and ca199 may be independent risk factors for and biomarkers of lung cancer-associated stroke.', 'abstract objective:  the  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  investigate  the  diagnostic  power  of  the  adrenocorticotropin  (acth)  stimulation test in patients with primary aldosteronism (pa) and those with aldosterone-producing adenoma (apa). design: this study was based on a retrospective database analysis. subjects and methods: we assessed 158 hypertensive patients with a high plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (arr)  including 97 with at least one positive confirmatory test result who did not undergo surgery and comprised a “possible  pa” group, 19 with negative results in all tests who were the “non-pa” group, and 41 diagnosed with apa following  surgery who were the apa group. the “confirmed pa group” included apa patients and patients from the possible pa  group showing both high arr and hypokalemia. one case was diagnosed as a metastasis. results: receiver-operating characteristic (roc) analysis showed that the diagnostic accuracy of acth test was not  very effective in differentiating between apa patients and possible pa and non-pa patients. the optimal cut-off value  of maximal plasma aldosterone concentration for differentiating between patient in the confirmed pa group and other  patients showed moderate accuracy. conclusions: the acth test may not be useful as a screening or confirmatory test, but the test may be useful for  differentiating between patients with confirmed pa and the rest of the cohort. the positive finding of the acth test  may at least support a higher likelihood of lateralizing on adrenal venous sampling.', 'abstract objectives  this  study  assessed  the  anxiolytic  effectiveness  of  a  test  diet  (royal  canin  feline  calm  diet)  supplemented with l-tryptophan and alpha-casozepine. methods  subjects  were  24  cats  that  were  classified  as  mildly  or  markedly  fearful  based  on  the  presence  of  a  person in their home room. three different protocols were used to assess anxiety: (1) evaluation of the response  to a human in the cat’s home room (home room test); (2) analysis of the response to placement in an empty test  room (open-field test); and (3) analysis of the response to an unfamiliar human (human interaction test). all three  protocols were first run at baseline, and the results were used to assign the animals to control and test diet groups  that showed equivalent fear and anxiety. both groups were retested on the three protocols after 2 weeks (test 1)  and again after 4 weeks (test 2). results  the diet groups differed for two behavioral measures in the open-field test: inactivity duration and inactivity  frequency. the control group showed statistically significant increases in inactivity duration between baseline and  test 1 and baseline and test 2, while the group fed the test diet showed a marginally not significant decrease in  inactivity duration between baseline and test 1 and a not significant decrease for test 2. there was also a significant  increase in inactivity frequency between baseline and test 1 in the test diet group and marginally not significant  decrease in the control group. there were no differences between groups in the approach of the cats toward people  for the home room test and the human interaction test. conclusions and relevance  these results suggest that the test diet reduced the anxiety response to placement in  an unfamiliar location, but that fear in the presence of an unfamiliar person was not counteracted by the diet.', 'abstract background: recent reports suggest that alcohol use may have a

transmission could explain young adult use of common psychoactive substances. we tested  a sequential structural equation model using data from the national longitudinal survey of  youth. during young adulthood, fast lhs explained 61% of the variance in overall liability  for substance use. faster parent lhs predicted poorer health and lesser alcohol use, greater  neuroticism  and  cigarette

about 20% of the variation in self-assessed health between siblings can be ascribed to (measured and unmeasured) family factors. measured family factors, such as parental education and father’s occupation, could account only for a small part of the family effect. furthermore, the results imply that it is unlikely that there is substantial bias due to family effects in the association between edu- cation and self-assessed health. this strengthens the conclusions from prior studies on the association between education and self-assessed health.', 'we consider the low-prevalence linearized seir epidemic model for a society that has resolved to keep future infections low in anticipation of a vaccine. the society can vary its amount of potentiallyinfection-spreading activity over time, within a certain feasible range. because the activity has social or economic value, the society aims to maximize activity overall subject to infection rate constraints. we find that consistent policies are the worst possible in terms of activity, while the best policies alternate between high and low activity. in a variant involving multiple subpopulations, we find that the best policies are maximally coordinated (maintaining similar prevalence among subpopulations) but oscillatory (having growth rates that vary in time). it turns out that linearized seir is mathematically equivalent to an idealized racecar model (with different subpopulations corresponding to different cars) and the amount of fuel used corresponds to the amount of activity. using this analogy, steady v-shaped formations (in which one subpopulation â€œleads the wayâ€\\x9d with consistently higher prevalence and activity, while others follow behind with lower prevalence and activity) are especially problematic. these formations are very effective at minimizing fuel use, hence very ineffective at boosting activity. in an appendix, we obtain analogous results for alternative notions of activity, which incorporate crowding effects.', 'abstract objectives: to examine retrospectively the relationship between acute kidney injury (aki) and acute myocardial infarction (ami), and the association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (egfr) at admission and aki outcome. methods: aki was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (scr) by (cid:2)0.3 mg/dl within 48 h or an increase in scr to (cid:2)1.5 times baseline within the first 7 days of hospitalization. patients with ami were divided into subgroups according to their egfr at admission and the development of aki. results: this study enrolled 396 patients with ami;

population-level interventions could reduce this imminent risk. vascular risk factors such as type 2 di- abetes, hypertension, dietary fat intake, high cholesterol, and obesity have emerged as important inﬂuences on the risk of both vascular and alzheimer’s dementia. under- standing the reasons for differences between populations in genetic vulnerability and environmental exposures may help to identify modiﬁable risk factors that may lead to effective prevention of vascular and alzheimer’s dementia.', 'abstract duffey, kiyah j., and barry m. popkin. shifts in patterns and consumption of beverages between 1965 and 2002. obesity. 2007;15:2739 –2747. background: beverage patterning may play a role in par- tially explaining the rising rates of obesity in the united states, yet little work on overall trends and patterns exits. our objective was to examine trends and patterns of bever- age consumption among u.s. adults. methods: we used data from the nationally representative nationwide food consumption surveys (1965, 1977 to 1978) and the national health and nutrition surveys (1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2002). to examine trends we determined percent consuming and per capita and per consumer caloric intake from all beverages. we used cluster analysis to determine year-specific beverage pat- terns in 1977 and 2002. results: the percentage of calories from beverages signif- icantly increased between 1965 (11.8%), 1977 (14.2%), 1988 (18.5%), and 2002 (21.0%); this represents an overall increase of 222 calories per person per day from beverages, resulting largely from increased intake of calorically sweet- ened beverages. beverage patterns in 2002 were more com- plex than in 1977 and were dominated by a greater number of beverages, reflecting the increase in alcohol, soda, and diet beverages. conclusion: calories from beverages increased substan- tially from 1965 to 2002, providing a considerable source of daily calories. given the upward trends in calorically sweet- ened, nutrient-deficient beverages and the shifts in overall', 'abstract stettler, nicolas, arezoo zomorrodi, and jill c. posner. predictive value of weight-for-age to identify overweight children. obesity. 2007;15:3106 –3112. objective: the objective was to assess the predictive value of weight-for-age to identify overweight children and ado- lescents in the unusual research or public health situations where height is not available to calculate bmi. research methods and procedures: data from the national health and nutrition examination survey 1999 to 2004 were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and pos- itive and negative predictive values of selected weight-for- age cut-off points to identify overweight children and ado- lescents (as defined by bmi (cid:1)95th percentile). positive and negative predictive values are dependent on prevalence and are reported here for this study population only. results: the 50th and 75th weight-for-age percentiles had good sensitivity (100% and 99.6%, respectively), but poor positive predictive value (23.7% and 37.0%, respectively), while the 95th and 97th percentiles had reasonable positive predictive value (80.3% and 91.5%, respectively), but lim- ited sensitivity (82.0% and 66.7%, respectively) to identify overweight subjects. the properties of weight-for-age per- centiles to identify overweight subjects differed between sex, age, and race/ethnicity but remain within a relatively narrow range. discussion: no single weight-for-age cut-off point was found to identify overweight children and adolescents with acceptable values for all properties and, therefore, cannot be', 'abstract objective: to investigate the incidence of insulin resistance (ir) and diabetes in patients with chronic hepatic schistosomiasis japonica (hsj) and portosystemic shunts (pss). methods: pre- and post-contrasted computed tomography images obtained from patients with hsj and control subjects were reviewed by two radiologists who identified and graded any shunting vessels. anthropometric measurements, hepatic enzymes, lipid profile, blood levels of albumin, glucose, insulin and homeostasis model assessment (homa-2) index of all participants were also assessed. results: fifty-two patients with hsj and 30 control subjects were involved in the study. the coronary, short gastric and perisplenic veins were the most common shunting vessels. there were no significant differences between patients and controls in terms of body mass index or liver function. the degree of shunting vessels, blood glucose, oral glucose tolerance test120/0, insulin, homa-2 index, glycosylated haemoglobin, cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein, and c- reactive protein were significantly higher in the patients with ir. a positive correlation was found between the degree of the shunting vessels and the homa-2 index. conclusions: patients with chronic hsj and pss without liver dysfunction had a high incidence of ir and diabetes. the study showed that pss and ir are related and therefore patients with pss should be screened for ir and vice versa.'], 0: ['abstract the present study has been undertaken to examine the growth trajectory of the higher education (he) sector across all  the countries in the gcc (gulf cooperation council) region, the transition toward internationalization, quality initiatives  undertaken, and movement toward regional integration. the study aims to provide a review for the shifting paradigm through  concepts of internationalization in the literature review and to probe on the themes facing the gcc in their adaptation  to internationalization. the study is based on secondary data, mainly of the websites of 167 universities/higher education  institutions (heis) of gcc, which were analyzed for their adaptation to internationalization. the results show the various  perspectives of internationalization with the suggestion on regional integration. it is hoped the study would provide the heis  and the policy makers with a strong foundation on their internationalization efforts.', 'abstract the purpose of this study was to examine the cross-cultural differences in the knowledge, definitions, and current training  and educational experiences of domestic violence (dv) among third-year undergraduate nursing, dental, and medical students  from two distinct universities in northern ireland and jordan. a convenience sample of 774 undergraduate students was  recruited. analysis was based on gender, culture, and educational speciality, as seen through the integrated lens of a social  ecological and feminist theory model. the results showed that a substantial percentage of all participants had never received  any education or training on dv in their undergraduate programs. the majority of participants had good knowledge about  dv, and half of the participants believed that dv is “common” in their respective countries. significant gender and cultural  differences in the definition of dv were also revealed, with northern irish students and female students in both cultures  more likely to regard a range of behaviors as a form of dv. the research findings suggest several potential directions for  change, emphasizing the importance of establishing a systematic evidence-based multidisciplinary and interagency approach  to teaching and learning for student health care professionals on the topic of dv in their undergraduate programs.', 'abstract  over three decades crime counts in england and wales, as throughout the western world, have fallen. less attention  has been paid to the distribution of crime across households, though this is crucial in determining optimal distribu- tion of limited policing resources in pursuing the aim of distributive justice. the writers have previously demonstrated  that in england and wales the distribution of crime victimisation has remained pretty much unchanged over the  period of the crime drop. the present paper seeks to extend the study of changes in the distribution of victimisa- tion over time using data from 25 countries contributing data to the international crime victimisation survey (icvs)  sweeps (1989–2000). while fragmentary, the data mirror the trends discerned in england and wales. the trends are  not an artefact of the inclusion of particular countries in particular sweeps. the demographic, economical, geographi- cal and social household characteristics associated with victimisation are consistent across time. the suggested policy  implication is the need for greater emphasis on preventing multiple victimisation.', 'abstract objective:  this  study  investigated  the  protective  effect  of  fk506  in  podocytes  and  the  correlation  of  trpc6  with  podocyte injury repair. methods: mpc5 were cultured in vitro, parallel with the control group, an ang ii stimulation group, and an fk506  intervention group. the apoptosis rate with flow cytometry also detected trpc6 mrna and protein expression by rt- pcr and western blot, and then observed the distribution of trpc6 with indirect immunofluorescence labeling under  confocal microscope. results: the activities of podocytes significantly increased after fk506 intervention for 24 hours and 48 hours when  compared with the ang ii stimulation group, and the apoptosis rate was markedly lower than that of the ang ii stimulation  group, while in contrast to trpc6 mrna and protein expression. conclusion: fk506 can directly act on the podocytes to inhibit ang ii-induced damage on podocyte structures and  reduce  the  apoptosis  rate  of  podocytes,  which  may  be  related  to  stabilizing  trpc6  expression  and  distribution  in  podocytes by fk506, thus maintaining the structure and function integrity of the slit diaphragm and playing a role in  protecting podocytes and antiproteinuria.', 'abstract in the present contribution, we examine the link between societal crisis situations and belief in conspiracy  theories. contrary to common assumptions, belief in conspiracy theories has been prevalent throughout  human history. we first illustrate historical incidents suggesting that societal crisis situations—defined as  impactful and rapid societal change that calls established power structures, norms of conduct, or even the  existence of specific people or groups into question—have stimulated belief in conspiracy theories. we then  review the psychological literature to explain why this is the case. evidence suggests that the aversive feelings  that people experience when in crisis—fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control—stimulate  a motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social  situations. we then explain that after being formed, conspiracy theories can become historical narratives  that may spread through cultural transmission. we conclude that conspiracy theories originate particularly  in crisis situations and may form the basis for how people subsequently remember and mentally represent  a historical event.', 'abstract the objective of the study wasto identify factors associated with use of services for adolescent mental health problems in  an australian community-based sample. logistic regression analysis was conducted on data collected from 636 parents and  their adolescent child  to  identify  individual and  family variables predicting parent report  of service  use for  mental health  problems in the adolescent 12 months later. the services most reported by parents to have been accessed were school- based ones. multivariate analysis found that the following were associated with service use 12 months later: the adolescent  being female, parent report of peer problems and hyperactivity, single-parent household, the parent being australian born,  and prior service use by the adolescent. parental overcontrol was associated with reduced likelihood of service use at follow- up. no association was found between service use at follow-up and parent gender, socioeconomic status, number of siblings,  parent psychopathology, family social connectedness, and prior service use by the parent. no association was also found for  family environment factors, parental attachment, or for the adolescent’s emotional competence or use of social support. the  results indicate that families provide a potential target for interventions aimed at increasing use of professional services for  adolescent mental health problems.', 'abstract collateral  intimate  partner  homicide  (ciph)  is  an  underinvestigated  genre  of  intimate  partner  violence  (ipv)

investigate the effect of immunosuppressive anticancer therapy on titre levels of anti-hepatitis b surface antibodies (anti-hbs) in hepatitis b surface antigen (hbsag) negative and anti-hbs positive patients with haematological malignancies or solid tumours. methods: this retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients with haematological malignancies or solid tumours. pretreatment hbsag negative and anti-hbs positive patients were included in the analysis. anti-hepatitis b core antibody status was used to evaluate vaccinated patients and those with resolved hbv infections. results: the medical records of 237 patients were reviewed retrospectively. the median anti-hbs titre decreased significantly after anticancer therapy compared with the pretreatment median anti- hbs titre in all patients (71 miu/ml versus 57 miu/ml). anti-hbs titre decreased significantly in patients with haematological malignancies (70 miu/m versus 37 miu/ml) and in patients adminis- tered

', 'abstract political  scientists  interested  in  studying  the  political  implications  of  citizens’  cognitive  abilities  often  turn  to  readily  available “intelligence ratings” in the american national election studies (anes). these ratings are generally thought  to represent respondents’ cognitive abilities, albeit imperfectly. i hypothesize that these ratings do not reflect more- objective  tests  of  cognitive  ability,  and  instead  better  capture  considerations  related  to  the  political  subject  of  the  interviews  and  other  contextual  factors.  in  the  2012  anes,  which  contained  a  cognitive  ability  test  (“wordsum”),  i  find that political engagement and demographic factors but not actual measurements of cognitive ability are associated with  interviewer intelligence rating scores. in bivariate analyses, verbal intelligence and interviewer ratings are moderately  correlated with one another, consistent with conventional wisdom. but this correlation is a spurious one, as the same  is  also  true  for  political  engagement,  education,  and  household  income.  further,  in  multivariate  models,  wordsum  scores were neither statistically nor substantively predictive of interviewer ratings. the results suggest that interviewer  ratings are better understood as proxies for political engagement, not cognitive ability. i conclude by arguing that the  growing importance of studying cognitive ability in political science makes it necessary to include more-objective verbal  intelligence tests more frequently in public opinion surveys.', 'abstract there exists a strong relationship between having a criminal history and experiencing barriers to employment. negative  credentials facilitate the social and economic exclusion of individuals with criminal records. however, previous research has  not concretely identified whether the stratification of economic opportunities by individual-level criminal records may be  further affecting those who demonstrate substance use histories. in this study, we examine the substance use and criminal  history profiles of probationers participating in an experimental drug treatment study and how probationer characteristics  affect  employment  outcomes  and  gross  earnings  at  both  the  6-  and  12-month  follow-up  periods.  we  hypothesize  that  substance use and criminal history have a main effect and interactional relationship that reduces the odds of self-reporting  employment and decreases gross earnings outcomes of probationer. our results demonstrate that substance use history and  criminal history has a main effect on employment and earnings outcomes.', 'abstract.  a  series  of  experiments  measured  the  audiovisual  stimulus  onset  asynchrony  (soaav), yielding facilitative multisensory integration. we evaluated (1) the range of soaav  over which facilitation occurred when unisensory stimuli were weak; (2) whether the range  of  soaav  producing  facilitation  supported  the  hypothesis  that  physiological  simultaneity  of  unisensory  activity  governs  multisensory  facilitation;  and  (3)  whether  av  multisensory  facilitation depended on relative stimulus intensity. we compared response-time distributions  to unisensory auditory (a) and visual (v) stimuli with those to av stimuli over a wide range  (300 and 20 ms increments) of soaav, across four conditions of varying stimulus intensity. in  condition 1, the intensity of unisensory stimuli was adjusted such that d\\ue039 ≈ 2. in condition 2,  v stimulus intensity was increased (d\\ue039 \\ue02e 4), while a stimulus intensity was as in condition 1.  in  condition  3, a  stimulus  intensity  was  increased  (d\\ue039  \\ue02e  4)  while  v  stimulus  intensity  was  as  in  condition  1.  in  condition  4,  both  a  and  v  stimulus  intensities  were  increased  to  clearly suprathreshold levels (d\\ue039 \\ue02e 4). across all conditions of stimulus intensity, significant  multisensory facilitation occurred exclusively for simultaneously presented a and v stimuli. in  addition, facilitation increased as stimulus intensity increased, in disagreement with inverse  effectiveness.  these  results  indicate  that  the  requirements  for  facilitative  multisensory  integration include both physical and physiological simultaneity.', 'abstract the reason why the trayvon martin murder trial and similar court cases create a philosophical rift in our nation is due in  part to flaws in the delivery of multicultural education. traditional multicultural instruction does not prepare citizens for the  subtleties and complexities of race relations. this study investigates critical strategies and practices that address multicultural  missing gaps. i also seek to fill a void in the literature created by a lack of student input regarding teaching strategies that  encourage lifelong learning. students (n = 337) enrolled at a midwestern university were asked to rate the efficacy of selected  instructional strategies. utilizing a 9-point likert-type scale, students gave themselves a personal growth rating of 7.15 (sd  = 1.47). variables important to predicting that growth (r2 = .56, p < .0005) were a six-factor variable known as a non-color- blind  instructional  approach  (t  =  10.509,  p  ≤  .0005),  allowing  students  an  opportunity  to  form  their  own  opinions  apart  from the instructor (t = 4.797, p ≤ .0005), and a state law that mandated multicultural training (t = 3.234, p = .001). results  demonstrated that utilizing a 35% traditional and 65% critical pedagogy mixture when teaching multicultural education helped  promote win/win scenarios for education candidates hoping to become difference makers.', 'abstract: inspections to villages are an important mechanism for the chinese government to gain and retain its ruling legitimacy. however, whether inspections have been effectively utilized for that designated purpose of sustainable governance remains less clear. we know very little about how the chinese government employs inspections to boost its public approval. this study sets out to examine that effect, contending that inspections to chinese villages signiﬁcantly boost the public approval of village leaderships by promoting the governing efﬁcacy of village leaders. the consistent practice of inspections results in a sustained level of public support for the chinese government. this causal relationship between inspections and public approval holds, ﬁrst, by improving village social welfare and economic development, and second, by securing for village leaders essential political and ﬁnancial support from higher authorities to better represent villagers’ interests and mediate conﬂicts among villagers. using data of 961 randomly selected villages across china, the empirical analysis shows that chinese government inspections signiﬁcantly boost villagers’ approval regarding their village leaders.', 'abstract although many schools are equipped with the latest instructional technologies, multiple studies have indicated that more  than half of the teachers equipped with computers only use them for administrative functions, and only half of their students  report using technology more than once a week. many faculty members lack the technological proficiency needed to take  advantage of these new technologies, making them unable to bring these technologies into the classroom and leading to  many standing unused in the classroom. this study analyzes teachers’ perceptions of technology use in the classroom by  surveying  those  who  participated  in  the teachup!  technology  empowerment  program  created  and  developed  by  digital  opportunity trust usa, inc. (dot usa). the results show that teachers who were part of dot usa’s teachup! program  perceived a significant increase in the areas of student engagement, student excitement, student acceleration of

self-expandable metal stent (sems) implantation may rapidly improve  the symptoms of malignant esophageal stenosis and tracheoesophageal fistulas (tef).  however, dysphagia often returns subsequently and repeated endoscopic intervention may  be necessary. the aims of the study were to identify the risk factors of complications, and  the frequency and efficacy of repeated endoscopic interventions; and to provide technical  recommendations on appropriate stent selection. methods: we analyzed retrospectively the clinical data of 212 patients with locally advanced  esophageal cancer who underwent sems implantation. results: a total of 238 sems implantations were performed with 99.06% technical success  and 1.26% procedure-related deaths in the enrolled 212 cases. complications occurred in 84  patients (39.62%) and in 55 cases (25.94%) repeated endoscopic procedures were required.  early reintervention 24–48 h after the stent implantations was necessary due to stent  migration (12 cases), arrhythmia (2 cases), intolerable retrosternal pain (1 case) and dyspnea  (1 case). an average of 1.98 repeated gastroscopies (range 1–6; median 2), 13.58 weeks (range  1.5–48; median 11) after the stent implantation were performed during the follow-up period:  37 stent repositions, 23 restent implantations, 15 endoscopic esophageal dilations and 7  stent removals. in 48 cases (87.3%) oral feeding of patients was made possible by endoscopic  interventions. conclusions: in a quarter of sems implantations, complications occur that can be successfully  managed by endoscopic interventions. our experiences have shown that individualized stent  choice may substantially reduce the complications rate and make repeated endoscopic  interventions easier.', 'abstract quantile  treatment

knowledge, value, and meaning are made in contemporary conditions? analyzing fundamental elements in the changing syntax of existing visual software ontology—the ways current social media platforms and aggregators organize and categorize social media images—this article relates how visual materials created within social media platforms manifest distinct modes of knowledge production and acquisition. first, i analyze the structure of social media images within data streams as opposed to previous information organization in a structured database. while the database has no pre- defined notions of time and thus challenges traditional linear forms, the data stream re-emphasizes the linearity of a particular data sequence and activates a set of new relations to contemporary temporalities. next, i show how these visual arrangements and temporal principles are manifested and discussed in three artworks: ‘‘untitled’’ (perfect lovers) by felix gonzalez-torres (1991), the clock by christian marclay (2011), and last clock by jussi a¨ ngesleva¨ and ross cooper (2002). by emphasizing the technical and poetic ways in which social media situate the present as a ‘‘thick’’ historical unit that embodies multiple and synchronous temporalities, this article illuminates some of the conditions, challenges, and tensions between former visual structures and current ones, and unfolds the cultural significations of contemporary big visual data.', 'abstract harvesting marine renewable energy remains to be a prime focus of researchers across the globe both in environmental

despite  the  fact  that  vocational  adolescents  are  in  a  disadvantaged  position  regarding  their  post-secondary  high  school  routes, research has highlighted the resistant and innovative ways they set in motion so as to grapple with their estranging  schooling experiences. our article aims to contribute to this research area by focusing on how adolescents’ narration of  their schooling frames their life planning. in particular, we explore a major finding of our research—namely, their defending  of vocational training—by means of the notion of ambivalent biographical identity. we argue (a) that today’s adolescents do  not openly reject vocational training, and they try to transform the unofficial skills and knowledge obtained in their cultures  into official cultural capital capable of making them enter the job market and (b) that their life planning is tied up with a  biographical identity formation through which they try to coherently reconcile their embodied cultures with the vocational  qualifications they aspire to acquire.', 'abstract this  paper  addresses  historical  and  contemporary  issues  of  leadership  in  armenia.  five  leadership  models  have  been  acknowledged in armenia during its four thousand year history: monarchic, church, national, communist, and democratic  leadership. each model has been presented within its historical context and analyzed in light of current leadership behaviors  in armenia. the results of the study show that (a) current armenian leaders seem to reflect the behaviors and attitudes of  the historical leadership models above; (b) history should matter in leadership studies to understand leadership behaviors, in  this case in armenia, and how the past continues to shape their current worldviews and social identities; and (c) democracy  imported  to  armenia  from  the  west,  with  little  considerations  of  the  historical  characteristics  of  the  armenian  people,  has  not  produced  the  desired  democratic  reforms  since  1991  independence.  perhaps  an  integrative  approach  to  all  five  leadership models is necessary to address leadership challenges in armenia

'abstract this paper discusses how an interactive artwork, the crowd-sourced intelligence agency (csia), can contribute to discussions of big data intelligence analytics. the csia is a publicly accessible open source intelligence (osint) system that was constructed using information gathered from technical manuals, research reports, academic papers, leaked documents, and freedom of

false- positives, as well as how the display of information through an interface can affect the judgment of an intelligence agent. the public has the right to ask questions about how a computer program determines if they are a threat to national security and to question the practicality of using statistical pattern recognition algorithms in place of human judgment. currently, the public’s lack of access to both big data and the actual datasets intelligence agencies use to train their classification algorithms keeps the possibility of performing effective sous-dataveillance out of reach. without this data, the results returned by the csia will not be identical to those of intelligence agencies. because we have replicated how osint is processed, however, our results will resemble the type of results and mistakes made by osint systems. the csia takes some initial steps toward contributing to an informed public debate about large-scale monitoring of open source, social media data and provides a prototype for counterveillance and sousveillance tools for citizens.', 'abstract:  the  arms  race  between  deception  and  detection  is  likely  to  have  played  out  between individuals in different status hierarchies, with low-status individuals more likely  to be deceivers and  high-status individuals  more  likely to be detectors than the other way  around.  memory  and  its  distortion  may  be  temporarily  employed  first  to  keep  truthful  information  away  from  both  self  and  others  and  later  to  retrieve  accurate  information  to  benefit  the  self.  using  a  dual-retrieval  paradigm,  we tested the  hypothesis  that  people  are  likely to deceive themselves to better deceive high- rather than equal-status others. college  student  participants  were  explicitly  instructed  (study  1  and  2)  or  induced  (study  3)  to  deceive either a high-status teacher or an equal-status fellow student. when interacting with  the  high-  but  not  equal-status  target,  participants  in  three  studies  genuinely  remembered  fewer  previously  studied  items  than  they  did  on  a  second  memory  test  alone  without  the  deceiving  target.  the  results  support  the  view  that  self-deception  responds  to  status  hierarchy that registers probabilities of deception detection such that people are more likely  to self-deceive high- rather than equal-status others.

policy makers and health care managers in  malaysia. our study examined the factors affecting the total inpatient pharmacy cost (tinpc) at the universiti kebangsaan  malaysia medical centre (ukmmc). in this retrospective study, we used 2011 administration electronic prescriptions records  and casemix databases at ukmmc to examine the impact of sociodemographic, diagnostic, and drug variables on the tinpc.  bivariate and multivariate analyses of the factors associated with tinpc were conducted. the mean inpatient pharmacy cost  per patient was usd 102.07 (sd = 24.76). in the multivariate analysis, length of stay (los; b = 0.349, p < .0005) and severity  level iii (b = 0.253, p < .0005) were the primary factors affecting the tinpc. for each day increase in the los and each  increase of a case of severity level iii, there was an increase of approximately usd 11.97 and usd 171.53 in the tinpc per  year, respectively. moreover, the number of prescribed items of drugs and supplies was positively associated with the tinpc  (b = 0.081, p < .0005). gender appears to have affected the tinpc; male patients seem to be associated with a higher tinpc  than females (mean = 139.55, 95% confidence interval [ci]: 112.97-166.13, p < .001). surgical procedures were associated  with higher cost than medical cases (mean = 87.93, 95% ci: 61.00-114.85, p < .001). malay (myr 242.02, sd = 65.37) and  chinese (myr 214.66, sd = 27.99) ethnicities contributed to a lower tinpc compared with indian (myr 613.93, sd =  98.41) and other ethnicities (myr 578.47, sd = 144.51). a longer hospitalization period accompanied by major complications  and comorbidities had the greatest influence on the tinpc.', 'abstract this article aims to undertake a study of the holy woman by qaisra shahraz in terms of how it brings forth the woman  question  by  effectively  reflecting  on  the  dangerous  chemistry  of  tradition  and  religion—a  chemistry  meant  to  legitimize  ritualization of violence. this naturally entails discussion on the way tradition is made to conspire with religion against women  with an exclusive theoretical underpinning of postcolonial feminism. the author has kept the focus of study limited to the  issues of female sexuality, celibacy, and hijab. evidently, the discussion dilates upon how religion is superseded by tradition.  this unavoidably causes circumstances culminating in realities that stamp the destitute and dismay of women hailing from the  third world postcolonial order.', 'abstract the study attempts to approach aging in india from three perspectives, namely, the well-being of an aging individual, the aging  household, and the aging population. the aspects, namely, work, financial dependence, integration, empowerment, and elder  abuse are studied and their relation to age, gender, and marital status is investigated. the data sets pertaining to the national  sample surveys for the reference periods 1986-1987, 1995-1996, and 2004 are primarily utilized for the purpose. the data  sets from building knowledge base on population ageing in india survey, 2011, are also utilized for information on elder  abuse. the results show that the older males are more likely to participate in household activities when compared with the  older females. the married older adults are also more likely to participate in household activities when compared with their  widowed counterparts. in a similar way, gender and marital status are found to be associated with empowerment of older  adults. the working older adults, those who possess property and/or assets are more likely to be financially independent.  furthermore, the older females and the financially dependent older adults are more likely to face abuses of different kinds.  households are classified into three different types. type i households have no older adults, type ii households have older  adults and other younger members, and type iii households have older adults only. results show that type iii households  are found to be relatively more deprived and report higher average monthly expenditure when compared with other types  of households.', 'abstract countries  that  rely  on  natural  resource  rents  (that  is,  the  revenue  generated  from  the  sale  of  natural  resources)  may  suffer  from  a  variety  of  social  problems.  this  exploratory  study  reviews the natural resource extraction literature to derive a ‘natural resource rents–homicide’  hypothesis.  data  for  173  countries  for  the  years  2000  to  2012  are  examined  to  determine  if  there  is  a  correlation  between  natural  resource  rents  and  homicide  rates.  multilevel  growth  models suggest that natural resource rents are positively correlated with homicide rates within  countries (level 1) but not between them (level 2). importantly, the correlation between natural  resource rents and homicide is strongest when natural resource rents are lagged. we conclude  by suggesting that increasing natural resource rents may be counterproductive over the long run  and sow the seeds for a future increase in homicide.', 'abstract although residential segregation is known to have declined for some racial groups in america, much less is known about change in the relative socioeconomic quality of the neighborhoods where different racial and ethnic groups live. using census data for 1980–2010, we find that the neighborhoods where whites and minorities reside have become more alike in terms of neighborhood poverty and median income, largely because whites now live in poorer neighborhoods and because african americans live in less-poor neigh- borhoods. the narrowing of black-white neighborhood inequality since 1980 has been sizable, far exceeding the narrowing of hispanic-white neighborhood inequality; nonetheless, despite blacks’ relative gains, the disparity in black- white neighborhood economic conditions remains very large. asian americans, on the other hand, now reside in neighborhoods that are economically similar to the neighborhoods where whites reside. regression analyses reveal that racial in u.s. metropolitan areas where neighborhood inequality declined the most racial residential segregation declined the most.', 'abstract here i propose procedural replication as a method for diagnosing errors and omissions and identifying research artifacts  in published studies. the goal of procedural replication is not to make substantive contributions so much as improve  research practice, or how scientists go about doing science. this is accomplished by generating checklists of lessons  learned  that  scholars  can  use  to  assess  the  reliability  of  new  or  existing  studies,  guide  editorial  reviews,  and  make  scientific knowledge production more reliable. i demonstrate the method by implementing a procedural replication of  michael ross’s controversial finding that democracy has no effect on child mortality. i find this null finding is an artifact  of the way five-year averages were computed and the static nature of the preferred model. i demonstrate, using causal  diagrams, how concerns about listwise deletion and selection bias affecting previous studies may have been overstated.  i also provide a checklist with lessons learned.', 'abstract: background: discrimination is a common experience for blacks across various developmental periods. although much is known about the effect of discrimination on suicidal ideation of adults, less is known about the same association in black youth. aim: we examined the association between discrimination and suicidal ideation in a national sample of black youth. we also explored gender and ethnic differences in this association. methods: we used data from the national survey of american life-adolescents (nsal-a), 2003–2004. in total, 1170 black adolescents entered the study. this number was composed of 810 african american and 360 caribbean black youth (aged 13 to 17 years). demographic and socioeconomic factors were controls, perceived discrimination was the predictor, and lifetime suicidal ideation was the outcome. logistic regression was used to test the association between perceived discrimination and suicidal ideation in the pooled sample, as well as based on ethnicity and gender. results: in the pooled sample of black youth, higher perceived discrimination was associated with higher odds of suicidal ideation (odds ratio (or) = 1.09; 95% conﬁdence interval (ci) = 1.02−1.17). this association was signiﬁcant net of age, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. we did not ﬁnd interactions between perceived discrimination and ethnicity or gender on suicidal ideation. perceived discrimination was associated with suicidal ideation in african americans (ci = 1.09; 95% ci = 1.01−1.17) and caribbean blacks (ci = 1.16; 95% ci = 1.03−1.32), males (ci = 1.11; 95% ci = 1.00−1.25), and females (ci = 1.08; 95% ci = 1.00−1.16). conclusion: discrimination jeopardizes the mental health of black youth. in a universal pattern, discrimination is associated with suicidal ideation in black youth. more research is needed on this topic.', 'abstract the purpose of this article is to suggest a (preliminary) taxonomy and research agenda for the topic of “firms,  crowds,  and  innovation”  and  to  provide  an  introduction  to  the  associated  special  issue.  we  specifically  discuss how various crowd-related phenomena and practices—for example, crowdsourcing, crowdfunding,  user innovation, and peer production—relate to theories of the firm, with particular attention on “sociality”  in firms and markets. we first briefly review extant theories of the firm and then discuss three theoretical  aspects  of  sociality  related  to  crowds  in  the  context  of  strategy,  organizations,  and  innovation:  (1)  the  functions of sociality (sociality as extension of rationality, sociality as sensing and signaling, sociality as matching  and identity), (2) the forms of sociality (independent/aggregate and interacting/emergent forms of sociality),  and  (3)  the  failures  of  sociality  (misattribution  and  misapplication).  we  conclude  with  an  outline  of  future  research directions and introduce the special issue papers and essays.', 'abstract state governments are now the principal source of immigrant legislation in the us. existing research presents contradictory  findings concerning the sources of pro- and anti-immigration state legislation. however, research has not adequately  accounted  for  the  multidimensional  nature  of  immigrant  legislation  and  the  fact  that  many  variables  hypothesized  to  affect  state  legislation  encompass  both  within-state,  time-varying  effects  and  time-invariant,  cross-sectional  effects.  measurement  and  research  design  strategies  to  address  these  problems  are  applied  to  a  dataset  of

potential attitudinal and behavioral impact of anthropogenic global warming (agw) conspiracy beliefs, it  is important to understand their causes and moderators. here, two explanations for the variation in these beliefs are  engaged: the first is the choice among elites to frame agw using the phrase ‘global warming’ (gw) as opposed to  ‘climate change’ (cc); the second is partisan motivated reasoning. a theory is then developed about the role of trust in  moderating the impact of the two frames on agw conspiracy beliefs. in the case of cc, which is perceived as less severe  than gw (and is therefore less identity threatening among republicans), it is hypothesized that trust will moderate hoax  beliefs among republicans. in the case of gw, where the implications of existence beliefs have policy consequences that  are more unpleasant, motivated reasoning will ‘win out’, and trust will not moderate conspiracy endorsement among  republicans.  the  results  from  an  original  question  framing  experiment  are  consistent  with  the  author’s  hypotheses.  whilst trust is a welcome commodity to those looking to persuade citizens to support agw-ameliorating policies, it is  not a cure-all, especially in the face of elite partisan cues that edify pre-existing attitudes/identities and arouse a strong  desire to engage in motivated reasoning.', 'abstract: adolescence is a developmental period marked by increased stress, especially among black youth. in addition to stress related to their developmental transition, social factors such as a perceived unsafe neighborhood impose additional risks. we examined gender and ethnic differences in the association between perceived neighborhood safety and major depressive disorder (mdd) among a national sample of black youth. we used data from the national survey of american life - adolescents (nsal-a), 2003–2004. in total, 1170 black adolescents entered the study. this number was composed of 810 african american and 360 caribbean black youth (age 13 to 17). demographic factors, perceived neighborhood safety, and mdd (composite international diagnostic interview, cidi) were measured. logistic regressions were used to test the association between neighborhood safety and mdd in the pooled sample, as well as based on ethnicity by gender groups. in the pooled sample of black youth, those who perceived their neighborhoods to be unsafe were at higher risk of mdd (odds ratio [or] = 1.25; 95% conﬁdence interval [ci] = 1.02-1.51). the perception that one’s neighborhood is unsafe was associated with a higher risk of mdd among african american males (or=1.41; 95% ci = 1.03–1.93) but not african american females or caribbean black males and females. in conclusion, perceived neighborhood safety is not a universal psychological determinant of mdd across ethnic by gender groups of black youth; however, policies and programs that enhance the sense of neighborhood safety may prevent mdd in male african american youth.', 'abstract in recent years, identifying ways to mitigate the risk of suicidal behavior in veteran populations has become a major public  health challenge of special significance. this has included identifying support options that can be used by veterans in times  of distress or crisis. for example, veterans at increased risk of suicide will sometimes voice complaints indicative of a need  for spiritual and pastoral care support. at u.s. department of veterans affairs medical centers, such support is provided to  veterans by clinical chaplains. this discussion paper aims to present the contextual framework in which chaplaincy services  are provided to veterans at increased risk of suicide, better conceptualize the spiritual and pastoral care needs of at-risk  veterans who request chaplaincy services, and offer practical suggestions for framing the provision of spiritual and pastoral  care services.', 'abstract on  august  9,  1974,  richard  m.  nixon  formally  resigned  the  presidency;  however,  folklore  hints  nixon  informally  quit  fulfilling  his  duties  well  before  then.  as  watergate  became  less  “a  third  rate  burglary”  than  “high  crimes  and  misdemeanors,”  rumors  of  president  nixon’s  wallowing,  wandering,  drinking,  and  mumbling  swirled.  yet  evidence  for such assertions has been thin, and prevailing scholarship offers compelling reasons to believe nixon’s institutional  protocols overrode his individual proclivities. this study offers a new, systematic look at nixon’s presidency by coding his  public events and private interactions with top government officials during every day of his presidency. contrary to our  expectations, the results corroborate the rumors: richard nixon effectively quit being president well before he resigned  the presidency. in fact, it turns out there was a defining moment when nixon disengaged from his administration: on  december 6, 1973, the day gerald ford was confirmed as vice president.', 'abstract although scarce, the literature addressing the effects of the economy on voter turnout and political attitudes has yielded  mixed  results.  by  using  individual,  longitudinal  data  from  spain—a  country  devastated  by  the  great  recession—our  study illuminates how the latest economic crisis has impacted citizens’ perceptions of voting. we analyze how economic  conditions and perceptions of the economy have transformed the belief that voting is a civic duty, which is one of the  strongest attitudinal predictors of turnout. our results suggest that hard times slightly weaken citizens’ sense of civic  duty, particularly among the youngest. however, the adverse effects of the economic crisis are compensated by the  positive effects of the electoral context, and as a consequence there is no aggregate decline in civic duty during the  period examined (2010–2012).', 'abstract a recent critique of copping, campbell, and muncer raised several issues concerning the validity of psychometric assessment techniques in the study of life history (lh) strategies. in this reply, some of our key concerns about relying on aggregated psy- chometric measures are explained, and we raise questions generally regarding the use of higher order factor structures. responses to some of the statistical issues raised by figueredo et al. are also detailed. we stand by our original conclusions and call for more careful consideration of instruments used to evaluate hypotheses derived from lh theory.', 'abstract integrating housing tenure in instrumental motivation theory predicts a tenure gap in electoral participation,  as homeowners would be more motivated to vote compared with tenants. the empirical question is whether  this effect is causal or rather due to selection into different housing tenures. this question is tackled using  coarsened exact matching (cem) on data for 19 countries, allowing us to better control for endogeneity.  even then, homeowners are found to vote more often than tenants. this association is stronger in countries  characterized by a strong pro-homeownership ideology and/or where the financialization of housing markets  turned houses into assets.', 'abstract thomas schelling’s the strategy of conflict carries significant behavioral implications which have been overlooked by economic  readers. i argue that these implications are central to schelling’s vision of game theory, that they fit well with recent advances  in experimental psychology and behavioral economics, and provide a comprehensive framework that can inform research  on strategy. in my view, schelling develops a non-mathematical approach to strategy which anticipates on gigerenzer and  selten’s “ecological rationality” program. this approach maps the processes involved in strategic reasoning and highlights  their reliance on the particular information structure of interactive social environments. building on this approach, i model  strategy as a heuristic form of reasoning that governs the way in which individuals search for and provide cues in situations  of mutually contingent choice. i conclude by examining how the reference to ecological rationality can help clarify schelling’s  contribution to game theory and outline potential avenues of research into strategic reasoning and interaction.', 'abstract: what is the role of contracting schemes for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities over the business cycle? we examine 4 different modeling schemes of nominal rigidities that all have the same average duration of contracts. we ﬁnd that calvo (1983) wage and price contracts may deliver welfare costs that are 3-4 times higher than taylor (1980) contracts. however, that result is sensitive to the monetary policy rule. we discuss the implications of modeling capital mobility and of adopting the mankiw and reis (2002) sticky infor- mation scheme for the welfare costs of nominal rigidities.', 'abstract. lustrous surface appearances can be elicited by simple image configurations with no texture  or specular highlights, as most prominently illustrated by helmholtz’ demonstration of stereoscopic  lustre.  three  types  of  explanatory  framework  have  been  proposed  for  stereoscopic  lustre,  which  attribute  the  phenomenon  to  a  binocular  luminance  conflict,  an  internalised  physical  regularity  (helmholtz), or to a disentangling of ‘‘essential’’ and ‘‘accidental’’ attributes in surface representations  (hering).  in  order  to  investigate  these  frameworks,  we  used  haploscopically  fused  half-images  of  centre-surround configurations in which the luminances of the test patch were dynamically modulated.  experiment 1 shows that stereoscopic lustre is not specifically tied to situations of a luminance conflict  between the eyes. experiment 2 identifies a novel aspect in the binocular temporal dynamics that  provides a physical basis for lustrous appearances, namely the occurrence of a temporal luminance  counter-modulation  between  the  eyes.  this  feature  sheds  some  light  on  the  internal  principles  underlying a disentangling of ‘‘accidental’’ and ‘‘essential’’ surface attributes. experiment 3 reveals an  asymmetry between a light and a dark reference level for the counter-modulations. this finding again  suggests an interpretation in terms of an internalised physical regularity with respect to the dynamics  of perceiving illuminated surfaces.', 'abstract graphic organizers (gos) are fast becoming acceptable standard instructional tools across subjects in the education arena  globally. however, this visual representation of information is yet to be recognized and integrated into the teaching methods  in nigerian schools. this study, therefore, presents a research-based investigation of the usefulness of gos in the appreciation  of prose literature in nigeria, with a view to foregrounding their use in nigerian schools. specifically, the study seeks to find  out whether senior secondary students in prose literature-in-english in nigeria who are taught with gos perform better  in  prose  and  comprehension  assessments.  four  project  secondary  schools  with  total  of  100  students  were  purposively  selected for the study. the schools were grouped into two: graphic-based schools (gbs) and non-graphic-based schools  (ngbs). whereas the gbs was exposed to instruction via eight graphic organizers, the ngbs served as control. subjected  to descriptive statistics and one-sample t test analysis, the investigation reveals that graphic organizers make students take  charge of the learning process in prose literature classes, and it concludes that these visual instructional elements guarantee  student understanding and achievement. the study, thus, recommends the incorporation of graphic organizers in the teaching  and learning processes across subjects in nigerian schools.', 'abstract: it is commonly assumed that judgments of dominance from faces partly rely on  implicit  judgments  of  bodily  strength.  in  two  studies,  we  demonstrate

political leaders is diagnostic of their private beliefs, and investigate through content analysis  of the rhetoric of saddam hussein, the former president of iraq. we collected saddam’s public speeches and interviews  on international affairs from 1977–2000, producing a data set of 330,000 words. from transcripts of saddam speaking  in private, we garnered a comparison corpus of 58,000 words. these text-sets were processed to locate markers of  conflict,  control  and  complexity.  we  find  that  saddam’s  hostile,  conflict-oriented  worldview  and  his  perception  of  himself as a significant political actor was consistent across public and private domains. the major difference between  these spheres was his more complex private view of international affairs compared to his more definitive public stance.  our evidence supports the notion that private beliefs can be inferred from the public speech of political leaders.', 'abstract the aim of this study was to develop a screening tool to screen children for development problems in a low-income setting.  childhood  development  problems  are  a  major  health  issue  faced  by  low-income  countries.  a  validated  screening  tool  is  needed for early identification of developmental delays. this article contains the first phase of a study that established a  relatively  simple  tool  to  screen  children  for  developmental  problems.  the  aim  of  the  first  phase  was  to  define  a  set  of  development indicators for the period of 2 to 12 months of life. the study methodology consisted of an extensive literature  review, to develop a set of indicators to measure child development in infancy. the indicators were placed within a framework  developed and used by experts in other countries. it consists of major domains, subdomains, specific aspects, and standards  of development. this was followed by content validation of the indicators. following review of literature, 171 indicators were  compiled under the framework. at the end of content validation, 125 indicators were retained in the framework. these  were pretested, and another 26 were removed following pretesting. the study developed a framework of indicators that  could be used as a development tool following a reference-based validation. the second phase of the study that included the  assessment of psychometric characteristics and reference-based validation would be published in a separate article.', 'abstract closing the health gap between indigenous and non-indigenous australians relies, in part, on addressing the poor

'abstract this article has been developed through the experience of working with the various organizations and individuals who have  been part of the no to named person campaign. the aim of the article is to understand the emergence of the named person  in scotland and to explain the significant distance between legislators and policy makers and those who have opposed the  named person initiative. we propose that the key to understanding these divergent views is predicated upon profoundly  different views of the family, the collapse of the ideal of family autonomy, and its replacement with what can be described as  “third way parenting.” here, the meaning of the “named person” as laid out in the children and young people (scotland)  act 2014, and the opposing views that have been made against this act are explained. the “named person” provision in the  legislation, it is argued, has developed with the rise of micro-managerial politics, the construction of the “at risk” child and  the anxiety expressed about the early years of children, seen most clearly in the significance of early intervention policies.  within this context, parenting has become problematized and increasingly understood as a skills activity requiring training,  support, and surveillance.', 'abstract this paper draws from critical data studies and related fields to investigate police officer-involved homicide data for los angeles county. we frame police officer-involved homicide data as a rhetorical tool that can reify certain assumptions about the world and extend regimes of power. we highlight the possibility that this type of sensitive civic data can be investigated and employed within local communities through creative practice. community involvement with data can create a countervailing force to powerful dominant narratives and supplement activist projects that hold local officials accountable for their actions. our analysis examines four los angeles county police officer-involved homicide data sets. first, we provide accounts of the semantics, granularity, scale and transparency of this local data. then, we describe a ‘‘counter data action,’’ an event that invited members of the community to identify the limits and challenges present in police officer-involved homicide data and to propose new methods for deriving meaning from these indicators and statistics.', 'abstract female genital cutting (fgc) involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and causes detrimental effects on woman’s physical and psychological health. estimates suggest that 130 million women and girls have experienced fgc worldwide. a frequently cited reason for performing this procedure is to restrict female sexuality. to test this idea, we examined women’s willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations (sociosexuality) among the traditional igbo community in southeastern nigeria, a region in which fgc is prevalent. women with fgc reported more restricted sociosexuality in all three domains (attitude, behavior, and desire) compared to women without fgc. our results suggest that fgc significantly restricts female extra-pair behavior. we provide evidence that this practice is partially attributable to sexual conflict over reproduction by decreasing paternity uncertainty and increasing the reproductive costs to women.', 'abstract background: the purpose of this study is to apply andersen’s behavioral model of health service use to men’s prisons to assess the direct and indirect effects of inmate predisposing characteristics through multiple types of need. also examined are the effects of prison-specific enabling factors and the variation in use of health services across prisons. this study uses a nationally representative u.s. sample of men incarcerated in state prisons (n = 8816) and generalized structural equation and multilevel modeling. five types of need—medical condition, illness, dental problem, unintentional injury, and intentional injury—are assessed for their association with use of health services. results: findings indicate that a number of inmate predisposing (age, race, education) and vulnerability (mood/ anxiety disorder,) characteristics are associated with use of health services but are partially mediated by enabling and need factors. each type of medical need has strong direct effects with mood/anxiety disorder emerging as the strongest total effect (including both direct effects and indirect effects through need). there is significant variation in rates of health service utilization across prisons that is not accounted for by the prison-level factors included in the multilevel model. conclusions: the varying patterns of health service use across prisons suggest that incarceration may be an important circumstance that shapes health. in other words, where someone is incarcerated may influence their ability to access and use services in response to medical need. it is important that prisons provide integrated services for inmates with mood/anxiety disorder given high comorbidity with other health conditions.', 'abstract background: multimorbidity defined as the “the coexistence of two or more chronic diseases” in one individual, is increasing in prevalence globally. the aim of this study is to compare the prevalence of

diabetes mellitus. methods:  changes  in  weight,  waist  circumference,  estimated  total  body  fat,  index  of  central  obesity  and  visceral  adiposity index were assessed using analysis of covariance and testing of treatment by strata for age, sex and baseline  waist circumference in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus randomized to blinded treatment with empagliflozin versus  placebo in clinical trials of 12 weeks (cohort 1) or 24 weeks (cohort 2) duration. results:  this  study  comprised  3300  patients  (cohort  1,  n = 823;  cohort  2,  n = 2477).  empagliflozin  reduced  weight,  waist  circumference  and  adiposity  indices  versus  placebo  in  both  cohorts.  adjusted  mean  (95%  confidence  interval)  change from baseline in empagliflozin versus placebo was −1.7 kg (−2.1 to −1.4 kg) and −1.9 kg (−2.1 to −1.7 kg) for body  weight (p < 0.001); −1.3 cm (−1.8 to −0.7 cm) and −1.3 cm (−1.7 to −1.0 cm) for waist circumference (p < 0.001); −0.2%  (−0.7% to 0.3%; p = 0.45) and −0.3% (−0.7% to 0.0%; p = 0.08) for estimated total body fat; −0.007 (−0.011 to −0.004)  and −0.008 (−0.010 to −0.006) for index of central obesity (p < 0.001); and −0.3 (−0.5 to 0.0; p = 0.07) and −0.4 (−0.7 to  −0.1; p = 0.003) for visceral adiposity index in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. adipose reductions were seen across most  age, sex and waist circumference subgroups. conclusion: empagliflozin significantly reduced weight and adiposity indices with the potential to improve cardiometabolic  risk among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.', 'abstract guo, guang,

sport canada’s long-term athlete development (ltad) model by  coaches and tries to understand the barriers to and enablers of these processes. ltad adoption was studied in 14 coaches  (5 female, 9 male) in seven sports while implementation was assessed among 10 different coaches (2 female, 8 male) from  nine sports. semistructured interviews ascertained coaches’ perceptions of and experiences with the ltad model in their  coaching practice. coaches adhered to the global vision and general principles of ltad. however, several barriers to ltad  adoption and implementation were identified. a mismatch between the model’s long-term and the short-term visions of  results in sport was perceived as deterrent to ltad adoption and implementation. coaches involved in early development  sports mentioned a lack of compatibility of ltad with the demands of their sport. coaches also perceived complexity in  ltad athlete’s developmental stage determination and the identification of “windows of opportunity” or critical periods.  these barriers should be addressed to complete diffusion of ltad among canadian coaches.', 'abstract scholars have become increasingly interested in how social relationships between individual risk-factors and adolescent behavior. an appreciable portion of this literature is concerned with the relationship between impulsivity and delinquency across neighborhood settings. the present article builds upon this growing body of research by considering the more nuanced pathways through which neighborhood disadvantage shapes the development of impulsivity and provides a situational context for impulsive tendencies to manifest in violent and aggressive behaviors. using a sample of 12,935 adolescent to from the national longitudinal study of adolescent adult health (add health) (mean age = 15.3, 51% female; 20% black, 17% hispanic), we demonstrate the extent to which variation in the association between impulsivity and delinquency across neighborhoods can be attributed to (1) differences in mean-levels of impulsivity and violence and (2) differences in coefﬁcients across neighborhoods. the results of a series of multivariate regression models indicate that impulsivity is positively associated with self-reported violence, and that this relationship is strongest among youth living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. the moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage can be attributed pri- marily to the stronger effect of impulsivity on violence in', 'abstract we analyze whether pakistan has become one domestically integrated rice market and whether pakistan’s rice markets are  integrated with the international markets, using monthly data from 1994 to 2011. during this period, major policy shifts took  place. in 2002, pakistan terminated the price support policy; in 2002-2004 export subsidies were introduced, and in 2008,  a minimum export price policy was adopted. we compare the degree of integration before and after 2002. we find that  most of the regional rice markets in pakistan are integrated domestically. pakistan’s rice markets are also integrated with  the international markets, using prices in thailand and vietnam as benchmarks. the price support policy abolition seems to  have contributed to greater domestic integration, while the subsequent export policies seem to have decreased the extent  of pakistan’s integration with the international markets. however, although pakistan’s rice markets generally are domestically  integrated as well as integrated with the international market, price adjustments are quite slow. thus, only 3% to 11% of  deviations from long-run equilibrium are adjusted on a monthly basis, indicating that a shock in international markets takes  several months to be fully transferred to prices in pakistan.', 'abstract:  parents  and  offspring  have  asymmetrical  preferences  with  respect  to  mate  choice. so far, several areas of disagreement have been identified, including beauty, family  background, and sexual strategies. this article proposes that mating age constitutes another  area of conflict, as parents desire their children to initiate mating at a different age than the  offspring  desire  it  for  themselves.  more  specifically,  the  hypothesis  is  tested  that  individuals prefer for their offspring to start having sexual relationships at a later age than  they prefer for themselves to do so. furthermore, it is hypothesized that individuals prefer  to marry at a later age than they prefer their offspring to marry. finally, the hypothesis is  tested  that  parents  prefer  their  daughters  to  marry  at  an  earlier  age  and  start  sexual  relationships later than their sons. evidence from two independent studies employing 751  british parents provides support for all three hypotheses.

on the capacity for sustainability of partnership type programs, which draws attention to the way partnership  programs are created, and programs that best meet the needs of the community are created by those in the community in  which services are provided.', 'abstract this article explores the ways in which data centre operators are currently reconfiguring the systems of energy and heat supply in european capitals, replacing conventional forms of heating with data-driven heat production, and becoming important energy suppliers. taking as an empirical object the heat generated from server halls, the article traces the expanding phenomenon of ‘waste heat recycling’ and charts the ways in which data centre operators in stockholm and paris direct waste heat through metropolitan district heating systems and urban homes, and valorise it. drawing on new materialisms, infrastructure studies and classical theory of production and destruction of value in capitalism, the article outlines two modes in which this process happens, namely infrastructural convergence and decentralisation of the data centre. these modes arguably help data centre operators convert big data from a source of value online into a raw material that needs to flow in the network irrespective of meaning. in this conversion process, the article argues, a new commodity is in a process of formation, that of computation traffic. altogether data-driven heat production is suggested to raise the importance of certain data processing nodes in northern europe, simultaneously intervening in the global politics of access, while neutralising external criticism towards big data by making urban life literally dependent on power from data streams.', 'abstract introduction: adiponectin (adipoq), involved in regulating glucose levels and fatty acid oxidation, plays key roles in  metabolic derangements such as gestational diabetes mellitus (gdm). previously, several studies have been conducted to  assess the association between adipoq +45 t/g polymorphism and risk of gdm. the results, however, are inconclusive.  we aimed to evaluate the effect of the polymorphism on the risk of gdm using a meta-analysis. materials  and  methods:  after  databases  searching,  eight  records  were  identified.  pooled  odds  ratios  (ors)  with  their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (cis) were used to evaluate the association between adipoq +45 t/g  polymorphism and risk of gdm. results: no significant association was observed between the adipoq +45 t/g polymorphism and the risk of gdm  (heterozygote  comparison:  or  =  1.15,  95%  ci,  0.70–1.89;  homozygote  comparison:  or  =  1.21,  95%  ci,  0.48–3.03;  dominant model: or = 0.86, 95% ci, 0.50–1.48, recessive model: or = 1.21, 95% ci, 0.62–2.33, and allele comparison:  or = 1.17, 95% ci, 0.79–1.76, respectively). apparent heterogeneity was detected. however, no evidence of publication  bias was found. conclusions: this meta-analysis provides evidence that the adipoq +45 t/g polymorphism was not related to the  risk of gdm. further multicenter, prospective studies with larger sample size would be valuable to confirm the result.', 'abstract although  ghana  has  developed  institutional  frameworks  and  has  enacted  legislations  which  among  other  things  seek  to  guarantee the cooperation and coordination of key stakeholders in disaster prevention, compliance is still a mirage. this has  resulted in increased susceptibility of national assets to preventable disasters. this article discusses what might have caused  the inferno that razed down one of west africa’s largest medical storage facilities—the central medical store (cms). the  disaster did not only manifest in property lost, basic medical supplies to neighboring countries were also severely interrupted.  by exploring the responses of key stakeholders, the emerging evidence indicates that preventive measures that could have  potentially averted the disaster or reduced its impact were not in place. the results further highlighted the apparent weak  institutional arrangements toward disaster risk prevention, preparedness, and mitigation, viewed as cross-cutting themes in  disaster management. the article argues that the scale of losses from this catastrophe epitomizes how the neglect for building  risk reduction can consign an entire region to the mercy of disaster events.', 'abstract school resource officers (sros) have become a permanent presence in many k-12 schools throughout the country. as a  result, an emerging body of research has focused on sros, particularly on how sros are viewed by students, teachers,  and the general public. this exploratory and descriptive research uses a different focus by examining the nature of crimes  for which sros were arrested in recent years with information gathered from online news sources. the current findings  are encouraging insofar as they reveal that sros are rarely arrested for criminal misconduct. when sros were arrested,  however, they are most often arrested for a sex-related offense involving a female adolescent. these sex-related incidents  generally occurred away from school property or during nonschool hours and rarely involved the use of physical force. the  implications of these findings for sro programs are discussed.', 'abstracted

using the horizontal spatial disparities produced as a result of viewing the same object with two laterally placed eyes, to derived depth or 3-d stereo information. this provides the advantage to break the camouflage of objects in front of similarly textured background and improves hand eye coordination for grasping objects close at hand. it is widely thought that about 5% of the population have a lazy eye and lack stereo vision, so it is often supposed that most of the population (95%) have good stereo abilities. we show that this is not the case; 68% have good to excellent stereo (the haves) and 32% have moderate to poor stereo (the have-nots). why so many people lack good 3-d stereo vision is unclear but it is likely to be neural and reversible.', 'abstract objective: this study was performed to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of a revascularization procedure in immature teeth with apical periodontitis using platelet-rich plasma (prp). the prp protocol and conventional revascularization protocol, which used a blood clot as the scaffold, were compared. methods: thirty non-vital immature permanent teeth were randomly categorized into two groups. after disinfecting the root canal space with triple antibiotic paste (1:1:1 ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and cefaclor), a tissue scaffold was created using either prp or a blood clot (control) and covered with white mineral trioxide aggregate. all cases were followed up clinically and radiographically for 12 months. differences in bone density, root length, and lesion size were calculated using preoperative and postoperative computed tomography images. the means of the differences in individual parameters in the blood clot and prp groups were compared using the mann–whitney u test. results: after 5 months, sensitivity tests (cold and electric pulp tests) elicited a delayed positive response in 23 sites. at 12 months, cone-beam computed tomography revealed resolution or a decrease in lesion size and an increase in bone density in all 30 (100%) teeth. additionally, continued root development was observed in 22 (73%) teeth and early root growth was observed in the test group (mineral trioxide aggregate with prp). conclusions: the results of this study suggest that prp can serve as a successful scaffold for regenerative endodontic treatment. with the exception of a significant increase in root length, the', 'abstract gordon-larsen, penny, linda s. adair, and barry m. popkin. ethnic differences in physical activity and inactivity patterns and overweight status.

moral  panic  theory  has  affected  a  paradigm  shift  in  the  social  construction  of  deviance  and  social  problems in the united states, without any real debate about its viability. this article raises key questions about this perspective  by offering the first ever critique of the seminal case study of british youth subcultures on which the paradigm is based. it  argues that when analyzed in the context of contemporary criticism of vandalism, hooliganism, and delinquency, the mods and  rockers case study never justified cohen’s original criteria for a moral panic.', 'abstract empathy is widely recognized as the psychological foundation for prosocial behavior, yet very little is known about methods  to increase affective empathy in students and trainees. the present research sought to assess the reliability and potential  boundary conditions of one such intervention—a brief emotional video featuring a boy diagnosed with cancer. study 1 found  that the video succeeded in indirectly increasing empathic concern for an african american victim of police abuse among  an ethnically diverse student sample in a classroom setting. study 2 replicated the effect in

lehman collapse in september 2008. the default of lehman brothers was a shock to the german banking system that was both unexpected and exogenous. we examine banks’ immediate reactions as well as their responses to unconventional monetary policy measures introduced shortly after the event { the introduction of full allot- ment and the change in eligibility criteria for collateral in central bank re(cid:12)nancing operations. our results show that market liquidity tightened after the lehman col- lapse but there is no evidence of (cid:12)re sales in the german banking sector. instead, we observe a broad-based (cid:13)ight to liquidity. the european central bank’s unconven- tional monetary policy had a strong impact on banks’ trading behavior by inducing shifts towards eligible securities and reducing pressure on market liquidity. this suggests that the ecb’s measures contributed to stabilizing the (cid:12)nancial system after the lehman collapse.', 'abstract although water is an essential commodity with virtually no substitute, poor bill payment on the part of water utility customers is  constraining the effort of water utility companies, especially those in developing countries to sustain and expand its provision.  in this backdrop, this article investigates the interrelationship and impact of a set of attitudinal and institutional factors on  the bill payment behavior of water utility customers of ghana. a conceptual model of payment behavior is developed and  tested using data from a cross-sectional survey of households in the greater accra region of ghana (garg) and the billing  records  of  ghana  water  company  limited  (gwcl).  among  the  constructs  considered  in  the  analysis,  service  quality,  corporate image, and monitoring and control are found to be the major determinants of customer satisfaction toward the  water utility, which in turn, together with the direct influence of monitoring and control measures and transaction time at  bill payment points, explains a significant part of the total variation in water customers’ bill payment behavior. we provide  in-depth discussion and policy implications of our findings.', 'abstract this paper problematizes the dichotomy between neo-liberalism and socialism and the tendency to view the post-socialist condition as a process of convergence with ‘western’ and ‘global’. it does so by analysing the development and implementation of a quality assurance and evaluation (qae) policy in school education in the context of the russian federation. since the dissolution of the soviet union, russian national qae policy has changed greatly and currently resembles the agendas of transnational organizations in education. at the same time, the national policy and the political discourse on quality continue to draw on soviet as well as post-soviet legacies. juxtaposing the case of russian qae policy with theoretical models of post-bureaucratic gover- nance in education, the paper also questions clear-cut distinctions between ‘old’ and ‘new’ gov- ernance regimes. the analysis in the paper is guided by two questions: 1) what has changed and what has remained unchanged in russian education policy with the transition from the soviet period to current state? and 2) how do different legacies and influences contribute to the qae policy implemented at the local level? the brief inquiry into the history of russian qae policy focuses on three periods: post-war soviet russia, the transition period of the 1980–1990s and modern russia. recognizing the specific characteristics of each of the reviewed periods, the paper highlights complexities, contradictions and continuities within and between previous and present regimes of education governance in russia. the analysis of the qae policy implemented at the local level demonstrates the blending of diverse legacies, and the prevalence of soviet-era practices in school governance.', 'abstract this article is a review of issues associated with measuring ethnicity and using ethnicity measures in social science research.  the review is oriented towards researchers who undertake secondary analyses of large-scale multipurpose social science  datasets. the article begins with an outline of two main approaches used in social surveys to measure ethnicity, the ‘mutually  exclusive category’ approach and the ‘multiple characteristics’ approach. we also describe approaches to the use of ethnicity  measures  in  cross-national  comparative  research.  we  emphasise  the  value  of  sensitivity  analyses.  we  also  encourage  researchers  to  carefully  consider  the  possible  relationships  between  ethnicity  and  other  important  variables  in  order  to  avoid spurious interpretations

different  rationales.  whereas  the  punishment of the offender is primarily determined by the severity of the crime (which includes  its foreseeable harmful consequences), the actual harm that is experienced by the victim drives  the  need  for  his  or  her  support  and  assistance.  with  the  introduction  of  the  victim  impact  statement  (vis),  in  which  victims  are  allowed  to  express  the  (harmful)  consequences  of  the  crime  on  their lives,  the question is raised whether allowing such  victim input  during criminal  proceedings would influence the offender’s sentence. the main goal of the current research is to  disentangle how a crime’s wrongfulness and harmfulness influence people’s reactions to offenders  and victims. we show that, whereas people’s perceptions of the offender (and the outcome of  the trial) are influenced by the severity of the crime, people’s judgements related to the victim  are  more  likely  to  be  influenced  by  an  interaction  between  the  severity  of  the  crime  and  the  experienced harm of the crime. that is, in this study no support was found for the argument that  the delivery of a vis would lead to a violation of the proportionality principle.', 'abstract observation oriented modeling is a novel approach toward conceptualizing and analyzing data. compared with traditional  parametric  statistics,  observation  oriented  modeling  is  more  intuitive,  relatively  free  of  assumptions,  and  encourages  researchers to stay close to their data. rather than estimating abstract population parameters, the overarching goal of the  analysis is to identify and explain distinct patterns within the observations. selected data from a recent study by craig et\\xa0al.  were  analyzed  using  observation  oriented  modeling;  this  analysis  was  contrasted  with  a  traditional  repeated  measures  anova  assessment.  various  pitfalls  in  traditional  parametric  analyses  were  avoided

library, embase and web of knowledge to find randomized controlled trials (rct) of 5-ht3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of postoperative shivering. two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then conducted a meta-analysis using revman 5.2. results: ultimately, 14 rcts that included 980 patients were included in the analysis. we found that: 1) the incidence of shivering was significantly lower in 5-ht3 groups than placebo groups (relative risk, [rr] ¼ 0.48, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.40 – 0.58); 2) there was no significant difference in the incidence of shivering between 5-ht3 groups and meperidine groups (rr ¼ 0.89, 95% ci 0.60 – 1.34). conclusion: 5-ht3 receptor antagonists appear to prevent postoperative shivering, with a broadly comparable efficacy to meperidine.', 'abstract the written autobiographical accounts of three life-course offenders, which were published following extended life-course  offending, were analyzed using a theory-led thematic analysis. the protagonists were each responsible for a broad range of  acquisitive and violent crimes, although different offense types are often studied as separate entities. the utility of narrative  theory was explored as a life-course theory by contrasting its framework with these disparate areas of inquiry, along the  developmental  trajectory  of  the  protagonist’s  account.  findings  showed  that  onset  began  with  trait-driven  and  versatile  offending, which progressed toward specialization, incorporating modus operandi and rational choice making. specialization  was underpinned by themes of violence and control. the concluding themes dealt with the process of desistance, which  was facilitated by a series of cognitive shifts, allowing these offenders to retain a core element of the “self.” results further  showed that narrative-identity played an influential role in the development of specialization and eventual desistance, but less  so with onset. narrative theory has the potential to aid understanding of the criminal life-course trajectory, which in turn  can assist in both detection and rehabilitation processes.', 'abstract one of the most contentious urban education policy issues in the united states today is the expansion of charter schools  and its repercussions. does the expansion of charter schools affect the racial and socioeconomic composition of traditional  public schools in the united states? this study provides empirical evidence on this question by relying on a panel design  that  uses  school-level  data  from  two  states  that  have  experimented  with  charter  schools  for  more  than  15  years:  ohio  and texas. using county-level, spatial, and enrollment-based measures of charter exposure, the changes from pre- to post- charter-legislation stages in the student compositions of public schools that do and do not face competition from charters  are examined. the results suggest that charter school presence contributes to aggregate-level changes in the share of non- hispanic white and free-lunch-eligible

understanding of the determinants of justification of ipv may provide  information  necessary  for  holistic  interventions.  this  study  sought  to  examine  the  magnitude,  extent,  and  predictors  of  justification of physical ipv against women among men and women in nigeria. data from 33,385 women and 15,486 men  from the 2008 nigerian demographic and health surveys were analyzed using chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions.  results  show  that  although  larger  proportions  of  women  justified  physical  ipv,  certain  categories  of  men  such  as  poor,  illiterate  men,  and  men  with  secondary  education  justified  abuse  more  than  women.  contrary  to  expectations,  access  to  radio/tv  increased  the  odds  of  justifying  abuse  among  women  thus  casting  doubts  on  program  content.  the  gender  differences observed for predictors of attitudes to physical ipv suggest a need for gender-tailored interventions to change  attitudes toward partner violence in nigeria.', 'abstract little is understood about the impact of level of motor competence on self-perceptions in adolescence, in particular how  this may differentially affect girls and boys. a sample of 1,568 14-year-old participants (766 girls and 802 boys) were grouped  into four motor competence levels (very low to high) based on the mccarron assessment of neuromuscular development  (mand). self-perceptions were assessed using the self-perception profile for adolescents. boys had higher self-perceptions  of  global  self-worth,  athletic  competence,  and  physical  appearance,  whereas  girls  had  higher  scores  for  close  friendships  and behavioral conduct. main effects in the predicted direction were found for motor competence for self-perceptions of  global self-worth, athletic competence, physical appearance, close friendships, social acceptance, and romantic appeal. these  findings indicate that level of motor competence is important in many aspects of self-perceptions, affecting girls and boys  differently. higher motor competence has a protective effect on psychosocial health, particularly for girls.', 'abstract couchsurfing  is  a  website  to  facilitate  hospitality  exchange  between  global  travelers  and  local  hosts.  as  couchsurfing  was  initiated,  it  was  just  an  alternative  accommodation  for  budget  travelers.  however,  now  couchsurfing  has  been  recognized  as  a  stylish  way  of  travel,  which  brings  new  forms  of  tourist  experiences  and  scenarios.  in  the  light  of  the  transformation  of  couchsurfing,  this  study  tries  to  explore  how  social-media  technologies,  hosts,  surfers,  and  spaces  are  mobilized  to  perform  couchsurfing.  goffman’s  performance  theory  as  well  as  the  extended concepts about online performance and tourist performance is adopted to analyze the  couchsurfing practice. by studying on couchsurfers’ online performance, offline performance, as  well as certain “inappropriate actions” hidden in the backstage, this study displays the series of  mechanism, which pushes couchsurfing from simply a hospitality exchange network to a specific  travel style.', 'abstract background: firearms are  the most commonly  used  weapon  to  commit  homicide  in  the  u.s. virtually all firearms enter the public marketplace through a

training as the traditional and alternative programs differ in their requirements.  classroom management can determine the success or failure of teachers and students. the research involved in this study  attempted  to  determine  whether  university-certified  teachers  differ  from  alternatively  certified  teachers  in  the  area  of  classroom management as determined by referrals, while controlling for level of education, years of teaching experience, age,  race, and gender at both middle and high school levels. the population for this study was the middle and high school teachers  in one rural south central texas school district. data were collected from the school district’s personnel database as well  as from the campus-level administrators. hierarchical regressions were used

victims  of  sexual  violence  in  the  uk:  sexual  assault  referral  centres  (sarcs) and voluntary sector organizations such as rape crisis. qualitative data from six case  study sites and quantitative data from 35 sexual violence projects in england and wales revealed  that  the  type  of  setting  affected  the  types  of  referrals  received  and  this,  in  turn,  shaped  the  services  required  by  victims  and  thus  the  nature  of  the  work  preformed.  consequently,  each  type of project had different emphases in their workload with which they were particularly well  equipped to handle. each type also had its own unique challenges; for example, while there were  notable benefits from delivering support in partnership models, such as sarcs, their affiliation  with statutory partners was perceived by some as a disadvantage, especially for those seeking  support  in  relation  to  historical  sexual  abuse.  on  the  other  hand,  those  delivering  support  in  voluntary sector projects had to work harder to establish and maintain relationships with other  agencies, but their independence was seen to be greater and this was perceived as a strength for  gaining access to victims and maintaining their confidence. both approaches had notable benefits  and,  given  the  diverse  array  of  sexual  violence  victims  in  any  given  area,  providing  these  two  different, yet complementary, approaches to supporting them is recommended.', 'abstract objectives: to develop and evaluate a protein microarray assay with horseradish peroxidase (hrp) chemiluminescence for quantification of a-fetoprotein (afp) in serum from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc). methods: a protein microarray assay for afp was developed. serum was collected from patients with hcc and healthy control subjects. afp was quantified using protein microarray and enzyme- linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). results: serum afp concentrations determined via protein microarray were positively correlated (r ¼ 0.973) with those determined via elisa in patients with hcc (n ¼ 60) and healthy control subjects (n ¼ 30). protein microarray showed 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for hcc diagnosis. elisa had 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. protein microarray effectively distinguished between patients with hcc and healthy control subjects (area under roc curve 0.974; 95% ci 0.000, 1.000). conclusion: protein microarray is a rapid, simple and low-cost alternative to elisa for detecting afp in human serum.', 'abstract okosun, ike s. and g.e.

prison population should be reversed, there is little agreement on how to achieve this goal. in this paper, i apply classic demographic methods to answer questions that assess the strategies, complexities, and realities of routes to zero and negative prison population growth. modiﬁed admissions policies have had the greatest impact on halting growth, whereas decreasing the length of sentences has had only a modest, short-term inﬂuence on the prison population size. as state and federal policy-makers consider reducing sentences for selective classes of nonviolent offenders, it is important that they have a holistic understanding of the implications of such policies. traditionally, this type of modiﬁcation has been coupled with more punitive policies for violent offenders, a pattern that reinforces the appearance of having “tough on crime” policies. model estimates show that such strategies countervail the overall goal of decreasing the size of the prison population. regardless of underlying reasons to halt growth of the prison populations, integration of the formal demography enable a means to assess the short- and long-term consequences of current and future policy.', 'abstract a growing number of college (postsecondary) students are in recovery from addiction to drugs or alcohol. in this article, we  discuss the experiences of students returning to a university campus after long-term addiction treatment. we also explore  the role of a collegiate recovery program (crp) in providing support, and in helping the students develop post-addiction  identities that will sustain them. to do so, we draw on goffman’s ideas related to stigma, as well as conceptualizations of  identity reconstruction as a practiced, lived experience. students interviewed faced a double bind; they sought to escape the  stigmatized identity of “addict,” but could not identify as typical students because of their abstinence from alcohol and drugs.  the crp helped them manage the transition to student life, provided a safe haven on campus, and provided an alternate and  positive identity: a student in recovery.', 'abstract the present article describes the development of a japanese version of the early childhood behavior questionnaire (ecbq).  the influence of social desirability on the japanese ecbq was investigated using a cross-sectional sample (n = 318). the  effects of gender and developmental changes in temperament were investigated in a longitudinal sample (n = 191). a three- factor structure was found in the instrument, the three factors being surgency/extraversion, negative affectivity, and effortful  control. these factors were the same as those found in the original ecbq. social desirability showed less influence on the  japanese ecbq, indicating the instrument was free from culture-based construct bias. this longitudinal study highlighted that  japanese toddlers have quieter, more withdrawn, and more passive
