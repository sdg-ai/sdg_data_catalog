The study establishes that households prefer the clean and convenient fuels. Even though LPG and electricity are indicated as expensive, they are the preferred fuels for cooking and lighting respectively. On the supply side, the study reviews the production of bioethanol from sugarcane and sweet sorghum. It is established that Kenya has suitable climate and land is available to grow sugarcane and sweet sorghum to supply bioethanol. Bioethanol is a modern clean fuel similar in characteristics to LPG and therefore can replace it as a household fuel. Bioethanol production and use will stimulate rural development.</td>\n",

The evolution of small-scale and large-scale geo-distributed datacenters operated and managed by individual cloud service providers raises new challenges in terms of effective global resource sharing and management of autonomously-controlled individual datacenter resources. Earlier solutions for geo-distributed clouds have focused primarily on achieving global efficiency in resource sharing that results in significant inefficiencies in local resource allocation for individual datacenters leading to unfairness in revenue and profit earned. In this paper, we propose a new contracts-based resource sharing model for federated geo-distributed clouds that allows cloud service providers to establish resource sharing contracts with individual datacenters apriori for defined time intervals during a 24 hour time period. Based on the established contracts, individual cloud service providers employ a cost-aware job scheduling and provisioning algorithm that enables tasks to complete and meet their response time requirements. The proposed techniques are evaluated through extensive experiments using realistic workloads and the results demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and resource sharing efficiency of the proposed model.</td>\n",

       "      <td>In a business environment where there are up to four gas stations on every major intersection, it's hard for retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. One way station owners can distinguish themselves and make a profit is to add alternative fuels, such as E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), to their product mix. When pricing and availability of the fuel are positive, adding E85 can be a profitable move that can position a station as “green.” Offering E85 allows stations to attract customers who already own one of the approximately 6 million flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) currently on U.S. roadways. These drivers may be attracted to a station offering a regionally produced fuel that displaces imported petroleum. In addition, stations offering E85 can market themselves to the numerous federal, state, and fuel provider fleets that have been required to buy alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) under federal regulations. Federal and fuel provider fleets, along with some state fleets, are also required to fill these AFVs with alternative fuels. While FFVs in regulated fleets represent a small portion of the FFVs on the road, they can often serve as anchors for a station's E85 sales and attract new customers seeking both fuel and non-fuel items. To help retailers predict the success or failure of installing E85 at their stations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published the “E85 Retail Business Case,” a comprehensive report that outlines a model fueling station owners can use to determine whether E85 would be right for them. This model answers the following two key questions affecting the potential profitability of adding E85 to the station mix.</td>\n",

The study employed the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Canonical co-integration regression techniques using data from 1975-2013. Among other results, the study revealed that income and urbanization increased fossil fuel consumption for all the countries. Also, while trade reduced fossil fuel consumption for Kenya and South Africa, the opposite was found for Ghana. In addition, the efficiency of the service sector reduced fossil fuel consumption for all the countries. The results of the study suggest efforts should be geared towards strengthening the energy efficiency system in each of these countries to help reduce fossil fuel consumption. Also, it is necessary that tariff and non-tariff barriers on products that do not promote energy efficiency is raised and vice versa, inter alia.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Historically, climate governance initiatives and associated scholarship have all but ignored the potential for Bglobal moral norms^ to bring about changes in the political conditions for global climate mitigation. This is surprising, since global moral norms are widely employed-as both a mode of governance and an analytical framework-in other domains of global governance, from international security to human rights. However, recent national-level fossil fuel divestments, moratoria on new coal mines and bans on gas fracking, among other developments, suggest the promise of global moral norms prohibiting fossil fuel-related activities, which this article terms Banti-fossil fuel norms^ (AFFNs). The article interprets recent examples of such activities in the light of international relations theory on moral norms to provide a general framework for understanding how AFFNs originate, spread and affect states. Specifically, the article argues that there are: (i) influential agents that are originating, and likely to continue to originate, AFFNs; and (ii) international and domestic mechanisms by which AFFNs are likely to spread widely among states and have a significant causal effect on the identity-related considerations or rational calculations of states in the direction of limiting or reducing the production or consumption of fossil fuels. The article also shows that, because they spread and affect state behaviour through mechanisms of Binternational socialization^ and domestic Bpolitical mobilization^, AFFNs cohere with and build upon the new paradigm of global climate governance crystallized in the Paris Agreement. AFFNs, the article concludes, represent a promising new frontier in climate governance.</td>\n",

Throughout the world, the growth of fuel cell research and application has been very rapid in the last ten years where successful pilot projects on many areas have been implemented. In Malaysia, approximately RM40 million has been granted to academic research institutions for fuel cell study and development. Recently, Malaysia saw the emergence of its first hydrogen fuel cell developer, signaling the readiness of the industrial sector to be involved in marketing the potential of fuel cells. Focusing mainly on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cell technology, this paper demonstrates the efforts by Malaysian institutions, both industrial and academic, to promote hydrogen fuel cell education, training, application, R&amp;D as well as technology transfer. Emphasis is given to the existing collaboration between G-Energy Technologies and UniversitiTeknologi MARA that culminates with the successful application of a locally developed fuel cell system for a single-seated vehicle. Briefs on the potential of realizing a large-scale utilization of this clean technology into Malaysia's mainstream power industry, domestic consumers and energy consuming industries is also discussed. Key challenges are also identified where pilot projects, government policy and infrastructural development is central to strengthen the prospect of hydrogen fuel cell implementation in Malaysia. ©©22001132TThheeAAutuhtohros.rPs.uPbulibshliesdhbedy EblyseEvilesrevLitedr.

       "157  Access to clean sources of energy constitutes a necessary condition for poverty alleviation. Provision of modern energy services is essential to improving the livelihood of households in the developing world. This study addresses both the demand and supply of bioethanol as a household fuel in urban Kenya. On the demand side, the study establishes that there is demand for clean fuels. The study establishes that households prefer the clean and convenient fuels. Even though LPG and electricity are indicated as expensive, they are the preferred fuels for cooking and lighting respectively. On the supply side, the study reviews the production of bioethanol from sugarcane and sweet sorghum. It is established that Kenya has suitable climate and land is available to grow sugarcane and sweet sorghum to supply bioethanol. Bioethanol is a modern clean fuel similar in characteristics to LPG and therefore can replace it as a household fuel. Bioethanol production and use will stimulate rural development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "4    -Cloud computing and its pay-as-you-go model continue to provide significant cost benefits and a seamless service delivery model for cloud consumers. The evolution of small-scale and large-scale geo-distributed datacenters operated and managed by individual cloud service providers raises new challenges in terms of effective global resource sharing and management of autonomously-controlled individual datacenter resources. Earlier solutions for geo-distributed clouds have focused primarily on achieving global efficiency in resource sharing that results in significant inefficiencies in local resource allocation for individual datacenters leading to unfairness in revenue and profit earned. In this paper, we propose a new contracts-based resource sharing model for federated geo-distributed clouds that allows cloud service providers to establish resource sharing contracts with individual datacenters apriori for defined time intervals during a 24 hour time period. Based on the established contracts, individual cloud service providers employ a cost-aware job scheduling and provisioning algorithm that enables tasks to complete and meet their response time requirements. The proposed techniques are evaluated through extensive experiments using realistic workloads and the results demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability and resource sharing efficiency of the proposed model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "95   In a business environment where there are up to four gas stations on every major intersection, it's hard for retailers to differentiate themselves from their competitors. One way station owners can distinguish themselves and make a profit is to add alternative fuels, such as E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline), to their product mix. When pricing and availability of the fuel are positive, adding E85 can be a profitable move that can position a station as “green.” Offering E85 allows stations to attract customers who already own one of the approximately 6 million flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) currently on U.S. roadways. These drivers may be attracted to a station offering a regionally produced fuel that displaces imported petroleum. In addition, stations offering E85 can market themselves to the numerous federal, state, and fuel provider fleets that have been required to buy alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) under federal regulations. Federal and fuel provider fleets, along with some state fleets, are also required to fill these AFVs with alternative fuels. While FFVs in regulated fleets represent a small portion of the FFVs on the road, they can often serve as anchors for a station's E85 sales and attract new customers seeking both fuel and non-fuel items. To help retailers predict the success or failure of installing E85 at their stations, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) published the “E85 Retail Business Case,” a comprehensive report that outlines a model fueling station owners can use to determine whether E85 would be right for them. This model answers the following two key questions affecting the potential profitability of adding E85 to the station mix.                                   \n",
       "82   This study investigated the determinants of fossil fuel consumption for three Sub-Saharan African countries - Ghana, Kenya and South Africa - to help manage the rising consumption fossil fuel consumption. The study employed the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square and Canonical co-integration regression techniques using data from 1975-2013. Among other results, the study revealed that income and urbanization increased fossil fuel consumption for all the countries. Also, while trade reduced fossil fuel consumption for Kenya and South Africa, the opposite was found for Ghana. In addition, the efficiency of the service sector reduced fossil fuel consumption for all the countries. The results of the study suggest efforts should be geared towards strengthening the energy efficiency system in each of these countries to help reduce fossil fuel consumption. Also, it is necessary that tariff and non-tariff barriers on products that do not promote energy efficiency is raised and vice versa, inter alia.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

However, recent national-level fossil fuel divestments, moratoria on new coal mines and bans on gas fracking, among other developments, suggest the promise of global moral norms prohibiting fossil fuel-related activities, which this article terms Banti-fossil fuel norms^ (AFFNs). The article interprets recent examples of such activities in the light of international relations theory on moral norms to provide a general framework for understanding how AFFNs originate, spread and affect states. Specifically, the article argues that there are: (i) influential agents that are originating, and likely to continue to originate, AFFNs; and (ii) international and domestic mechanisms by which AFFNs are likely to spread widely among states and have a significant causal effect on the identity-related considerations or rational calculations of states in the direction of limiting or reducing the production or consumption of fossil fuels. The article also shows that, because they spread and affect state behaviour through mechanisms of Binternational socialization^ and domestic Bpolitical mobilization^, AFFNs cohere with and build upon the new paradigm of global climate governance crystallized in the Paris Agreement. AFFNs, the article concludes, represent a promising new frontier in climate governance.   \n",
       "189  Hydrogen fuel cells are electrochemical power generators of high conversion efficiency and incredibly clean operation. Throughout the world, the growth of fuel cell research and application has been very rapid in the last ten years where successful pilot projects on many areas have been implemented. In Malaysia, approximately RM40 million has been granted to academic research institutions for fuel cell study and development. Recently, Malaysia saw the emergence of its first hydrogen fuel cell developer, signaling the readiness of the industrial sector to be involved in marketing the potential of fuel cells. Focusing mainly on Polymer Electrolyte Membrane fuel cell technology, this paper demonstrates the efforts by Malaysian institutions, both industrial and academic, to promote hydrogen fuel cell education, training, application, R&D as well as technology transfer. Emphasis is given to the existing collaboration between G-Energy Technologies and UniversitiTeknologi MARA that culminates with the successful application of a locally developed fuel cell system for a single-seated vehicle. Briefs on the potential of realizing a large-scale utilization of this clean technology into Malaysia's mainstream power industry, domestic consumers and energy consuming industries is also discussed. Key challenges are also identified where pilot projects, government policy and infrastructural development is central to strengthen the prospect of hydrogen fuel cell implementation in Malaysia. ©©22001132TThheeAAutuhtohros.rPs.uPbulibshliesdhbedy EblyseEvilesrevLitedr.

       "29   Nigeria reportedly experiences one of the world's largest illicit nancial out ows, with Nigerian politicians among those accused of diverting funds to nance hubs such as London.

       "10   Due to the deleterious effect of the illicit transfer of funds on Africa economies the paper determines and compares the volume of illicit funds which should have been used for development but otherwise channeled into private benefits in seven African countries during 2005-2015. Using the World Bank Residual Model, we found that illicit financial flows are being experienced in all the sample countries otherwise unabated. In quantum terms, illicit transfers of funds are more in upper-middle-income countries while and it was highest in low- income countries as a proportion of the country's GDP. The study concluded that relative to aggregate income low-income countries engage more in illicit financial transfers that the other income groups whereas in quantum terms it was substantial in upper-middleincome group. We recommend that all income groups should improve on regulatory controls in order cub illicit transfers in Africa, more importantly, the low-income group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
